                "narrative": "<p>Lake Andrusia is a 1,590 acre lake on the Cass chain of lakes which is connected via the Mississippi and Turtle rivers.  Water levels are influenced by the operation of a power dam on the Mississippi located upstream of Wolf Lake.  Andrusia is primarily managed for Walleye which is likely the most sought after species of fish on the chain.  There is a public access at the north end of the lake that is owned and maintained by the U.S. Forest Service; additional access to the lake is provided via the Mississippi River. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye were captured in lower numbers compared to previous assessments but still at a good catch rate of just over five per net.  Lengths ranged from 8 to 23 inches and averaged just under 15 inches.  The current Walleye population is comprised mostly of mid-range, eater sized fish.  Walleye fry are stocked into Andrusia on most years. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike abundance has been steadily increasing over time.  A total of 111 pike were captured at a rate of just over nine per net, the highest recorded for Andrusia.  Lengths ranged from 13 to over 35 inches and averaged in the low 20 inch range.  The abundance of pike smaller than 22 inches provides a great alternative for anglers on a day when the Walleyes aren't cooperating. <br> \n <br> \nMuskellunge in Andrusia are native to the system and continue to increase in popularity.  Though not targeted in standard lake surveys, three were captured with lengths up to 43 inches; muskies larger than 48 inches are common throughout the system. <br> \n <br> \nBluegills are low in density but can exhibit good size quality at times.  Trap nets captured 21 fish up to 9.5 inches in length.  The current population has an abundance of young fish with good growth rates so an abundance of larger Bluegills are possible in the next couple years. <br> \n <br> \nYellow Perch are abundant in Andrusia. A total of 947 were captured with fish measuring up to 12 inches.  Sixteen percent of perch captured were larger than 8 inches in length and nearly four percent were over 10 inches.  While a few perch make it to catchable sizes, their primary value is forage for predator species. <br> \n <br> \nA small number of Tullibee (Cisco) were captured in gill nets.  This species is also a very important forage item for musky, pike, and large Walleye because of their high nutrient value.  <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Lake Andrusia, in southeastern Beltrami County, is connected by the Mississippi River to the Cass Lake chain, and fish populations are influenced by movement between the lakes.  Primary fish species in Lake Andrusia are walleye, nothern pike, and yellow perch.  Muskellunge are also present but no special assessment targeting them has been conducted.  All of the species making up the fish community are maintained through natural reproduction.  Walleye fry are stocked only during years when the Big Lake Creek DNR walleye trap is operated.  A portion of the eggs taken are returned to the lake as fry.  Large stands of bulrush serve as spawning and nursery areas for many aquatic organisms (including fish), and care is taken to protect all in-lake habitat to ensure continued successful reproduction. Walleye were sampled in 1999 near the  all time high catch rate for this lake.  This catch rate was also higher than average for similar lakes in this area.  Most walleye sampled were between 12.0 and 16.0 inches.  The largest walleye sampled in this assessment was 26.5 inches.  Average weight was 1.1 pounds; similar to all previous assessments.Northern pike were sampled at the highest recorded catch rate over all previous assessments.  Average length and weight were 20.1 inches and 1.9 pounds respectively.  Aging suggests that successful natural reproduction occurs most years.  The largest nothern pike sampled was 32.3 inches.Yellow perch were abundant, nice sized, and had a relatively low incidence of parasites in this assessment.  This makes the perch population popular with anglers.  The largest perch sampled in this assessment was 12.3 inches, and average size was 6.9 inches.  Almost 17 percent of the sample was greater than 8 inches.  About one quarter of the perch had black spot and/or yellow grubs.  Fish with heavy infestations are not aesthetically pleasing but eating quality is not affected. Tullibee catch rate has shifted up and down over the years with no apparent trend.   An average weight of 1.1 pounds is comparable with most other assessments.  About one third of the tullibee had an internal parasite (Triaenophorous) which may be harmful to humans.  It appears as an encysted grub imbedded in the meat along the backbone.  Any tullibee havested which has this parasite should be cooked thoroughly to avoid possible transmission of the parasite.Largemouth bass, black crappie, bluegills, pumpkinseed sunfish, and rock bass are all minor components of this fishery, but none are overly abundant.  Rock bass are common, and are often captured incidentally while angling for other species.  Bluegills and pumpkinseed may be abundant enough to target at certain times of the year, but they are not common.  Little can be learned of the largemouth bass and black crappie populations from this type of survey.Other species sampled in small numbers in the 1999 assessment were white sucker, lake whitefish, and brown and yellow bullheads.Muskellunge have never been sampled in an assessment in Lake Andrusia but they are known to be present.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Andrusia is a 1,590-acre lake, located 10 miles east of Bemidji, MN and within the Cass Lake chain of lakes.  A targeted survey was completed on Lake Andrusia by Bemidji Area Fisheries staff during late July in 2019 to assess the nearshore fish community and overall health of the lake. <br> \n <br> \nIn this survey, 18 nearshore sites (100-foot) were evenly spaced along the lakeshore to sample a variety of aquatic habitat types and collect a representative sample of the nearshore fish community.  Depending on the habitat conditions at each site, backpack electrofishing and shoreline seining were attempted where possible.  A total of 10 sites were sampled with a seine, while backpack electrofishing was completed at all 18 sites.  A total of 26 species of fish were sampled, which included nine species (Banded Killifish, Blackchin Shiner, Cisco, Logperch, Mimic Shiner, Mottled Sculpin, Muskellunge, Pugnose Shiner, and Rock Bass) that are intolerant to disturbance or poor water quality. <br> \n <br> \nNearshore fish community data was analyzed with information collected from standard survey completed in 2019 to calculate a Fish-based Index of Biologic Integrity (FIBI) score to measure the biological condition and overall health of Lake Andrusia.  In Minnesota lakes, certain fish species cannot survive without clean water and healthy habitat (e.g. Blackchin Shiner, Least Darter, and Rock Bass), while other species are tolerant of degraded conditions (e.g. Black Bullhead, Fathead Minnow, and Green Sunfish).  The combination of fish species present may identify stressors negatively affecting the lake environment.  The FIBI score is composed of several fish community diversity and composition metrics to indicate the overall health of a lake by comparing it to what is expected for a healthy lake.  For additional information on FIBI, search for \"lake index of biological integrity\" on the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources website (www.mndnr.gov). <br> \n <br> \nAccording to the survey, Andrusia Lake is in good health with a FIBI score above the impairment and exceptional thresholds for aquatic life use determined for similar lakes.  In coordination with the Minnesota Pollution Control Agency, data from this survey will contribute biological information about the health of the fish community to the Mississippi River (Headwaters) Watershed assessment. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Lake Andrusia is one of several connected lakes joined via the Mississippi and Turtle Rivers that comprise the Cass Lake chain of lakes.  Andrusia supports a moderate amount of residential development along its lakeshore, including several resorts.  Lake Andrusia is located in southeastern Beltrami County approximately 10 miles east of Bemidji.  It is a 1,590 acre lake with a 60 foot maximum depth.  There is a USFS public access at the north end of the lake, just off of County Road 12 (Power Dam Road).  A scenic north woods lake, Andrusia lies within the boundaries of both the Leech Lake Indian Reservation and the Chippewa National Forest. <br> \n <br> \nWater levels in this system are affected by dam operations on the Mississippi River, both upstream and downstream of Andrusia.  Water level fluctuations can affect growth of emergent and submerged vegetation as well as availability of potential spawning habitat.  In addition, fish populations in these connected waters are frequently influenced by fish movement between lakes.  Primary fish species include walleye, northern pike, and yellow perch.  Other important species inhabiting the system include muskellunge, black crappie, tullibee (cisco), and white sucker.  Walleye is the main species of management interest. <br> \n <br> \nLake Andrusia is a popular destination among early season walleye anglers. The Mississippi River flows through the lake and is a major corridor of walleye migration during the spring spawning season.  Since spawning is usually completed shortly before the season opener, walleyes are often found working their way back through the system, feeding heavily along the way. <br> \n <br> \nLake Andrusia is the direct source of brood stock for the Big Lake Creek spawn taking station, although fish from the entire Cass Lake system participate in the spawning run.  Under DNR policy, ten percent of the annual walleye egg take is returned to the source water as fry.  In the Cass Lake Chain, any stocking or natural reproduction should be viewed in the context of the entire connected system of lakes. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye abundance in 2009 was at an all-time high, indicated by catch rates in experimental gill nets which have doubled since the mid-1980\u0019s.  This trend is consistent with increased walleye abundance in Cass Lake over a similar time period, as monitored through annual large lake sampling.  The last three assessments yielded gill net catch rates that were greater than what is typically expected for this type of lake.  In 2009, walleye ranged in length from 7 to 23 inches and were composed of nine different year classes.  The 2005 (age-4) and 2006 (age-3) year classes comprised 65% of the sample.  Growth rates are similar to other Bemidji area lakes of this type. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike abundance has varied little over the past several assessments.  Average size of pike over these same assessments has also been consistent.  Growth rates are above average when compared to other Bemidji area lakes of the same type.  At age-3, an average Lake Andrusia northern pike is 21.0 inches long, greater than the area lake class mean of 18.6 inches. <br> \n <br> \nMuskellunge are rarely captured in standard population assessments, but because of Andrusia\u0019s connectivity to other lakes with documented populations of muskellunge, it can be assumed that a fishable population exists.  Anglers should remember that muskellunge harvest restrictions on Andrusia fall under the statewide 48 inch minimum length regulation. <br> \n <br> \nYellow perch abundance over the past five assessments has been greater than what is typical for this lake type.  Perch are probably an important forage species for many predator species in Lake Andrusia.  Fifteen percent of perch in the 2009 sample were greater than eight inches in length. <br> \n <br> \nAnother important forage species captured during the 2009 assessment was tullibee (cisco), which was also at above average abundance levels.  Historically, tullibee abundance has varied widely, and it is commonly accepted that such variation in gill net catch rates simply reflects this species\u0019 pelagic nature in lakes. <br> \n <br> \nIn past assessments, bluegill were rarely captured; however, the 2009 trap net sample indicated an increase in abundance and a quality size structure.  Bluegill ranged from 3 to 9 inches in length. <br> \n <br> \nDevelopment pressure is increasing around the shorelines and within the watersheds of many Minnesota lakes.  This development can degrade water quality and impact valuable shoreline habitat.  Native shoreline vegetation provides habitat for fish and wildlife, filters harmful nutrients, and protects against shoreline erosion.  Lakeshore owners can minimize their impact on the shoreline and maintain a more natural setting while actually decreasing annual maintenance.
