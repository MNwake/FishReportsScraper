                "narrative": "<p>Cooks is a 99-acre lake with 90 acres (91%) of littoral area and a maximum depth of 19 feet.  Cooks Lake is located 4 miles northeast of Taft, Minnesota off Highway #48.  Cooks Lake, which has no public access, is just upstream of Island Reservoir on an unnamed tributary to the Cloquet River.  Cooks Lake was surveyed during the summer of 2009 as part of an effort to evaluate the impacts of the aquatic macrophyte wateshield on local lakes and to update information on fish populations. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye abundance of 1.0 per gillnet lift had increased since 1991 (0.2) but was still considered below average compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type.  Average size of 22.6 inches was large and growth was fast.  Five year-classes were represented from 1998 through 2004 and no walleye were younger than age-5. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike abundance of 4.8 per gillnet lift had decreased since 1991 (7.8) but was still considered typical compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type.  Average size of 27.2 inches was considered very large and growth was typical.  Age analysis revealed consistent recruitment with all year-classes represented from 1999 through 2007. <br> \n <br> \nYellow perch abundance of 8.0 per gillnet lift had decreased since 1991 (15.2) but was still considered typical compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type.  Average size of 6.6 inches was considered small and growth was typical.  Age analysis revealed only the 2003 and 2004 year-classes represented with 2004 being strong. <br> \n <br> \nBlack crappie abundance of 1.9 per trapnet lift had decreased since 1991 (8.0) but was still considered typical compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type.  Average size of 7.3 inches was considered small and growth was slow.  Age analysis revealed consistent recruitment with all year-classes represented from 2003 through 2007 and a strong 2006 year-class. <br> \n <br> \nBluegill abundance of 17.3 per trapnet lift was slightly greater than 1991 (16.8) but still considered above average compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type.  Average size of 4.6 inches was small and growth was slow.  Age analysis revealed consistent recruitment with all year-classes represented from 2000 through 2007 and a very strong 2005 year-class. <br> \n <br> \nOther fish species sampled include largemouth bass, pumpkinseed sunfish and smallmouth bass. <br> \n <br> \nInformation was collected on aquatic vegetation, substrate and water quality.  Diversity of aquatic plants was low with 24 species or species groups identified along 10 transects.  Muskgrass was the most frequently identified plant (100% of transects) followed by large-leaf pondweed and watershield (90% of transects).  Only two other species or species groups had a frequency of occurrence greater than 50%.  Lakeshore residents around Cooks Lake have reported a dramatic increase in the distribution and density of watershield in recent years.  In response, a special assessment of watershield was completed in conjunction with the 2009 survey.  An aerial photography analysis revealed that in 2003, 14.1 acres of Cooks Lake was covered with watershield.  In 2009, 14.7 acres were covered with watershield, a 3.4% increase from 2003.  It is suspected that low alkalinity as well as longer, warmer growing seasons are contributing factors to the increase in watershield abundance.  Other lakes in the Duluth Area (Sand and Cross in Carlton County) with similar water chemistry are experiencing increases in the abundance of watershield.  The most common substrate type was sand, which was identified at 100% of the transects.  All other substrate types identified had frequencies of occurrence less than 50%. Results of laboratory water analysis indicate Cooks is a slightly alkaline (pH 7.6), soft water lake (alkalinity 10 ppm) with low fertility (total phosphorus 0.018). <br> \n <br> \n</p>",
