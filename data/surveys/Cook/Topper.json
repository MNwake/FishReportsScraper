No brook trout over three years of age were collected.  The catch of one-year-old fish was low, but most fish from the 2008 stocking may not have been large enough to be taken in standard gill nets at the time this assessment was done.  All two-year-old fish taken were fin-clipped fish from the 2007 fingerling stocking.  Growth of those fish had been somewhat faster than average.  They reached an average length of 9.8 inches by the end of their second year. <br> \n <br> \nNo undesirable fish species were found.  Minnow traps collected brook stickleback and fairly high numbers of fathead minnow.  This was the first time Topper Lake was sampled with any gear capable of collecting small fish. <br> \n</p>",

Goals for brook trout in that plan were to maintain gill net catches of at least 10.0 fish/set, with two catchable-size (over 10 inch) year classes present. <br> \n <br> \nBrook trout were relatively abundant in Topper Lake in 2011, and their average size was within the normal range for brook trout taken spring assessments in this area.  The gill net catch exceeded the long range goal from the 2008 lake management plan, and was above average compared to other spring assessments of stream trout lakes in the area.  All recent stockings were represented in the catch, and brook trout up to five years of age were collected.  Growth had been slower than average for this area; three-year-old fish reached an average length of 11.4 inches at the end of their third year, compared to an area average of 13.0 inches in similar lakes.  The presence of relatively high numbers of three- and four-year-old fish indicated harvest in this lake was probably not excessive.  Results of this assessment seemed to indicate that survival of stocked fish was excellent.  Good long-term survival allowed the lake to provide relatively high quality fishing opportunities despite slower than average growth. <br> \n <br> \nNo exotic or undesirable fish species were collected in 2011.  Sampling with 0.25-in-mesh wire minnow traps confirmed the presence of several forage species, including Iowa darter, brook stickleback, fathead minnow, and northern redbelly dace. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Brook Trout were abundant in Topper Lake in 2015, and their average size was within the normal range (0.40-1.17 lb/fish) for Brook Trout taken spring assessments in this area.  The gill net catch of 16.00 Brook Trout/set exceeded the goal from the 2008 lake management plan (10.0 brook trout/set).  All recent stockings were represented in the catch, and Brook Trout as old as four years were collected.  Growth rates were below area averages for all ages sampled (1-4).  Three-year-old fish reached a mean length of 10.6 inches by the end of their third year, compared to an area average of 12.7 inches.     <br> \n <br> \nThe presence of relatively high numbers of three- and four-year-old fish indicated harvest in this lake was probably not excessive.  Results of this assessment seemed to indicate that survival of stocked fish was excellent.  Good survival allowed the lake to provide relatively high quality fishing opportunities despite slower than average growth. <br> \n <br> \nNo exotic or undesirable fish species were collected in 2015. As has been the case in past surveys high numbers of potential forage fish were collected in quarter-inch wire minnow traps.  Fathead Minnows appeared very abundant, with lower numbers of Brook Stickleback also captured. <br> \n <br> \n <br> \n</p>",
