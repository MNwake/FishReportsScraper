                "narrative": "<p>Mills Lake is located southeast of Lake Crystal and west of highway 169.  This fairly small (230 acre) lake has a maximum depth of about 7 feet.  A fishery survey was conducted on Mills Lake in August 2004 to assess the fish community and aquatic habitat.  Mills Lake was reclaimed in 1998, however common carp and black bullhead became reestablished soon after the reclamation due to failure of the outlet barrier.  By 2000, black bullhead dominated the fish community.  Low oxygen conditions occurred in the winter of 2000 to 2001 resulting in some winterkill of fish.  Black bullhead had further increased in abundance in 2003 and 2004.  In 2004, black bullhead were mostly 5 to 6 inches in length.  Some northern pike are present and are generally large, from 20 to 30 inches in length.  Bluegill and black crappie were present in moderate numbers.  Black crappie were mostly around 7 to 8 inches and the bluegill were around 6 to 7 inches long.  A public access is located off of highway 169.  An aeration system is operated on this lake in the winter.  Use caution when traveling on the ice.  </p>",

Mills Lake was reclaimed in 1998, however common carp and black bullhead became reestablished soon after the reclamation due to failure of the outlet barrier.  By 2000, black bullhead dominated the fish community.  Low oxygen conditions occurred in the winter of 2000 to 2001 resulting in some winterkill of fish.  Black bullhead had further increased in abundance in 2003.  Northern pike are present at a moderate abundance.  Most were between 20 and 30 inches in length.  Some black crappie, bluegill, largemouth bass, and yellow perch are present.  Some black crappie were up to 11 inches long and the largest bluegills were 8 inches.  </p>",
