Walleye ranged in size from 6.5 inches to 25.8 inches (6.3 lbs) in the sample with 43% of the fish 14 inches or longer. The walleye population is maintained thru natural reproduction.     The northern pike population has remained quite stable over the years with abundance about average compared to similar lakes in its class. Northern pike generally are small averaging about 1.5 pounds each. Northern pike up to 20 pounds have been recorded in previous surveys.     Yellow perch are present but not in high numbers, however there are some quality size fish with a sizeable number in the 10 inch to 13 inch range.</p>",

The 1989 gillnet catch was about 2 times higher than the two previous assessments. Except for Age V, year classes I - VII were well represented for Walleye. Northern Pike densities have remained stable and 1.5 lb fish are average, with an occasional large Northern Pike taken. Yellow Perch numbers have declined since the 1982 survey, and may not be sufficient to support the present Walleye population. A White Sucker removal project was undertaken in 1989 which may increase Yellow Perch recruitment.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Toohey Lake is located about 11 miles northwest of Tofte within the Superior National Forest. There is a Forest Service campground with seven sites on the lake off the Fourmile Grade Road (Forest Service 170), which includes a public boat access with concrete log ramp. The water is shallow and the access is best suited for smaller boats and canoes that can be launched in ankle deep water. The lake has dark brown, bog stained water and shallow depth, with a maximum depth of just eleven feet.   <br> \n <br> \nWalleye are the primary management species and the population is sustained through natural reproduction. The catch rate of 27.6 per gill net remained above the normal range for similar lakes for the fourth consecutive assessment of the lake. Size also remained similar to recent surveys with few Walleye longer than eighteen inches sampled. Age analysis identified eleven year classes including fish from each age between age-1 to age-10. These results indicate the lake continues to support a high density Walleye population with excellent opportunities for \"eater\" sized fish between 14 and 17 inches long. <br> \n <br> \nAnglers may also catch Yellow Perch large enough to harvest while fishing Toohey Lake. The catch rate of 11.4 per gill net was within the normal range for similar lakes and 54% of the catch exceeded ten inches in length. Age analysis determined ten year classes were present with fairly consistent reproduction and survival each year. Perch are also an important forage species and the population continues to persist through natural reproduction while providing some opportunities for anglers to harvest fish. <br> \n <br> \nWhite Sucker, another important forage species, were captured at a rate of 6.0 per gill net which is within the normal range for similar lakes.  <br> \n <br> \nA low density population of Northern Pike also inhabits the lake. Results from this survey were similar to all of the historic assessments of the lake that found pike rarely reach a size of interest to anglers.  <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Toohey Lake is a 368-acre lake located 11 miles northwest of Tofte in the Superior National Forest. The lake has a maximum depth of 11 feet and maintains a natural population of walleye, northern pike, yellow perch and white suckers. There is a shallow, gravel boat ramp and 5-unit rustic campground on the southwest end of the lake. The lake is wild and undeveloped and receives moderate fishing pressure in the summer and low pressure in the winter. In most winters snowmobiles are required to access the lake, as the main road to the lake is not normally plowed.   The lake has very little structure and is different from most lakes in the Finland area in that it has an abundance of bulrush stands and sandy substrate.  <br> \n <br> \nThe 2007 population assessment recording the highest walleye catch ever indicated an above average walleye population in Toohey Lake,. The assessment found high numbers of walleye between 14 and 17 inches (49%) but few walleye larger than 18 inches. Test nets found an abundance of smaller walleye (<13 inches) that bodes well for the future of walleye fishing here. Toohey Lake is popular with anglers targeting walleye and because of the darker water; it is one of the lakes in this area where walleye can be caught midday.   <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike numbers in Toohey Lake were average in 2007 and typical of lake class 16 lakes and the Toohey\u0019s sampling history.  The average size of northern pike in most of Toohey\u0019s assessments was less than two pounds and this held true in this assessment with northern pike averaging about 1.6 pounds. Northern pike over three pounds were uncommon in most assessments as was the case in 2007 where the largest northern pike was only 2.8 pounds.     <br> \n <br> \nYellow perch were collected in above average numbers and included a high number of quality size (>8.0 inches) fish. Yellow perch up to 12.5 inches were sampled with approximately 45% of the fish larger than 10 inches.  <br> \n</p>",

The walleye ranged from 6.8 inches to 22.5 inches (4.0 pounds) with approximately 47% of the fish sample ranging between 13 inches and 15.9 inches.  The walleye population in Toohey Lake was maintained entirely through natural reproduction.Test nets in this survey indicated that northern pike numbers were low, which was not unusual for this lake.  The few fish sampled were quite small, averaging less than 1 pound.Yellow perch were captured in average numbers compared to other lakes of this type.  The average size of yellow perch taken in this survey was 7.7 inches, however, there were a number of fish over 10 inches collected, including fish up to 13.6 inches.Toohey Lake is a shallow lake having a maximum depth of eleven feet.  It does have a concrete boat ramp, however, during low water periods launching a large boat can be very difficult if not impossible.  There is sometimes too little water to float a boat off of a trailer, and the deeper water is too far (across a sand flat) to back to.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Toohey Lake is a 369 acre lake located 11 miles northwest of Tofte in the Superior National Forest.  The lake has a maximum depth of 11 feet and maintains a natural population of walleye, northern pike, yellow perch and white suckers.  The lake is undeveloped and receives moderate fishing pressure in the summer and low pressure in the winter.  In most winters snowmobiles are required to access the lake because the main road to the lake is not normally plowed. <br> \n <br> \nThere is a shallow, sand boat ramp with a small dock and five-unit rustic campground on the southwest end of the lake.  Toohey has a very gradual drop-off.  The shallow (less than 3 feet), sandy, near-shore habitat extends 200 feet or more from dry land in most parts of the lake.  Therefore, it is difficult to submerge a boat trailer and in many cases boats need to be pushed or carried off of trailers, making the access most suited to small boats and canoes.  This very gradual drop-off also makes shore-fishing difficult around Toohey.  Even beyond the drop-off, the lake remains fairly shallow but the deepest pockets of water can be found around the northeast side of the lake's island. <br> \n <br> \nAlthough Toohey's unique lake structure can pose a challenge to anglers fishing from shore or large boats, it is very good fish habitat.  The shallow, sandy, near-shore habitat, with its many bulrush stands, creates good spawning habitat for walleye and yellow perch.  Toohey is not stocked and yet it naturally produces numbers of walleye and yellow perch far above average for the Finland Area. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye abundances are very high in Toohey.  In 2012, 40% of walleye sampled were 15-18 inches and the average size was 1 pound.  The largest walleye sampled was 26.6 inches and 6.6 pounds; it was 19 years old!  Although walleye are usually most active in low light hours, such as at twilight and at night, Toohey's dark, bog-stained water makes catching walleyes at mid-day possible. <br> \n <br> \nToohey's yellow perch population contains relatively high numbers of larger fish.  In the 2012 assessment, 35% of perch sampled were over 8 inches long and their average weight was 0.4 pounds.  Yellow perch in Toohey grow faster than average for the Finland Area and a high abundance of young-of-the year perch in 2012 suggests that the population could keep producing high numbers of large fish. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike abundance in Toohey Lake was below average for the Finland Area in 2012, but typical of Toohey's sampling history.  In the past 30 years, northern pike catch rates have always been low and fish are typically small (less than 1 pound).  The largest northern pike sampled in 2012 was only 18 inches long. <br> \n <br> \nOverall, Toohey is a veritable fish factory for yellow perch and walleye.  High abundances of these species sized for table fare can provide very good fishing.  However, the lake is most suited to smaller watercrafts and anglers may need to get crafty mid-summer when the availability of small perch as prey can cause a reluctant walleye bite. <br> \n</p>",
