Water clarity is good with a secchi disk reading of 16'.  There is no public access available.  A small resort is located on the north end of the lake, and a youth camp is on the southern end.   <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike were captured in high numbers at 9.7/gillnet, when compared to similar lakes.  Most ran on the small side, with an average length of 20.2\".  Northern pike at least 24\" in length made up 18% of the catch.  New northern pike regulations effective March 1st, 2018 include a possession limit of 10 fish.  Only 2 may be over 26\" and all fish between 22\"-26\" must be immediately released.  The intent of the regulation is to improve the harvest opportunity for pike and improve the fish community composition. <br> \n <br> \nThe black crappie gillnet catch of 4.7/net was high compared to similar lakes.  Average length was rather small at 5.9\".  The trapnet catch of 1.3/net was average compared to similar lakes.  Average size was a little nicer at 7.8\".  For both gears combined 35% were at least 8\" in length.  The bluegill trapnet catch was average at 11.0/net.  Most ran on the small side with an average length of 5.4\".  Bluegills measuring at least 7\" made up 17% of the catch. <br> \n <br> \nNo invasive species have been discovered in Hardy Lake, but they are located in the area.  Before and after launching lake users are required to inspect and remove any aquatic plants and animals from their watercraft and trailers as well as pull the plug and drain all water from the watercraft, including bilges, livewells and baitwells. <br> \n</p>",

About 49 homes/cabins were present along the 1.8 miles of shoreline in 1993.  Bottom soils in shallow water areas were mostly sand.  Some areas with gravel and rubble size (3-10\") rock were present.  Some detritus, muck and marl was found, primarily in areas with cattails.  Submergent vegetation was fairly abundant and grew to a depth of 20 feet.Northern pike were caught in \"high\" numbers in 1993, compared to similar type lakes.  Of the five age classes sampled, the 1991 year class was most abundant.  Growth was good.  Average size was 2.2 lbs..  Largemouth bass were caught in \"average\" numbers.  Bass sampled in 1993 were either young-of-the-year or age 3.  Bluegills were taken in \"high\" numbers and tended to be small and slow growing.  Five age classes were sampled and over one-half of the bluegills were from the 1988 year class.  Pumpkinseeds were also caught in \"high\" numbers.  Black crappies were caught at a rate which bordered on \"low.\"  All crappies sampled were age 5 and were slow growing.  Yellow perch were found in \"average\" numbers.  Yellow bullheads had \"high\" abundance and tended to be of small average size.  Hybrid sunfish were also present in the lake.</p>",

Hardy Lake is located in the Crow Wing River watershed.  A nearshore survey was conducted to assess the populations of both game and non-game fish species.  Ten 100' long sampling stations were evenly spaced around the lakeshore.  Each station was then sampled by backpack electrofishing, and if conditions allowed with a 15' or 50' 1/8th inch seine. <br> \n <br> \nThe survey took place on July 31, 2017, with all ten stations sampled by backpack electrofishing.  The 50' 1/8th inch seine was used at one station and the 15' 1/8th inch seine was used at an additional six stations.  Heavy vegetation, soft sediment, trees and branches, and deep water prevented the use of seines at the other three sampling sites.  Eleven species were sampled, including three species that are intolerant of habitat disturbance:  Iowa darter, blacknose shiner, and banded killifish.  This nearshore survey will be used along with the gillnet and trapnet survey conducted on July 10-12, 2017 to calculate a Fish-Based Index of Biotic Integrity (FIBI) score.  The FIBI uses fish community data to measure a lake's health by the types of fish species present and comparing it to what is expected for this type of lake. <br> \n</p>",
