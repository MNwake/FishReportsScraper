Taft Lake was surveyed during the summer of 2012 as part of the lake's regular sampling regime.  Taft Lake is located within the city limits of Richfield.  It is surrounded by city land, has a public fishing pier, and has numerous shoreline fishing opportunities. <br> \n <br> \nBluegill abundance has decreased since 2001 and considered below average for this lake type.  Bluegill mean length was 4.37 inches (3.15-5.94 inches) and the population is dominated by smaller fish.  Bluegill growth rates were below average.  Age analysis revealed limited and sporadic reproduction with representatives from the 2006, 2008, 2009, and 2011 year classes.  This is the best case scenario since multiple ages of blue gill were stocked in 2012 prior to the survey.   <br> \n <br> \nBlack crappie abundance has decreased since 2001 and considered below average for this lake type.  Black crappie mean length was 7.31 inches (6.34-8.74 inches) and is composed mostly smaller fish.  Black crappie growth rates were below average.  Age analysis revealed limited and sporadic reproduction with representatives from the 2006, 2008, 2009, and 2010 year classes. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye abundance was greater than 2001, and considered above average for this lake type.  Walleye mean length was 14.29 inches (12.60-16.30 inches) and population is composed of smaller individuals.  Walleye growth rates were below average. Age analysis revealed 2008, 2009, and 2010 year classes.    <br> \n <br> \nYellow perch abundance has increased since 2001 and considered above average for this lake type.  Yellow perch mean length was 6.05 inches (4.53-9.45 inches) and is dominated by smaller fish.  Yellow perch growth rates were below average.  Age analysis revealed representatives from all year classes from 2006 to 2011 with strong 2008 and 2009 year classes.    <br> \n <br> \nOther fish species sampled in the 2012 survey include black bullhead, common carp, golden shiner, hybrid sunfish, northern pike, white crappie, white sucker, and yellow bullhead.   <br> \n <br> \nWater quality measurements were taken on 7/23/2012.  The sampling site was taken in 43.0 feet of water.  Water clarity was measured with a secchi disk reading of 3.0 feet.  Dissolved oxygen ranged from 0.1 to 2.5 parts-per-million. Oxygen levels this low can lead to fish kills though none were reported to the local area fisheries office. <br> \n</p>",

Fishing opportunities consists of a fishing pier and several areas of open shoreline for shore angling.  Two open-water aeration systems are present to provide oxygen to a depth of 32 feet.  Taft Lake is managed as a Kid's Fishing Pond, and the program has stocked black crappie, bluegill, and channel catfish.Fifteen fish species were sampled during the 2001 population assessment, and the dominant fish species was black bullhead.  Other fish species present that provide some angling opportunities are crappies, bluegill, and largemouth bass.  The abundance of crappie is about average for this lake type with an average size of 6 inches in length.  Bluegill abundance was average for this lake type with an average length of 5 inches.  The practice of catch and release of largemouth bass may help reduce the number of black bullhead and smaller bluegills while providing an opportunity for anglers to catch larger fish. </p>",

This pond has been managed as a Fishing in the Neighborhood (FiN) pond since 2002 and is regularly stocked with Bluegill and Yellow Perch. In 2016, the City of Richfield in collaboration with FiN, installed several updates to improve fishing access at Taft Lake. A new handicapped-accessible fishing pier was installed on the Southwest side of the lake, and six groups of fishing blocks spaced evenly throughout the lake were installed. The lake is surrounded by park land and has a paved walking trail around the entire lake. Other amenities include close parking to the pier, restrooms, and ball fields in the park. In 2017, a Standard Survey was conducted to assess the gamefish population. <br> \n <br> \nNine Northern Pike were captured in the single gill net during this survey. Northern Pike measured from 19.1 to 30.9 inches in length, with a mean length of 23.9 inches. Northern Pike averaged 3.04 pounds.  <br> \n <br> \nThe most abundant species sampled during this survey was Bluegill. Lengths of Bluegills ranged from 3.1 to 7.0 inches, with a mean length of 4.1 inches.  <br> \n <br> \nBlack Crappie trap net catches were 7.3 per net. Black Crappie measured from 5.7 to 11.3 inches in length, with a mean length of 7.0 inches.  <br> \n <br> \nOne Walleye was captured in the gill net during this survey, which measured 19.7 inches in length. Three other Walleye were captured with trap nets with a mean length of 19.6 inches. Walleye are not stocked in the lake. <br> \n <br> \nOther species captured in low numbers during this survey included Black Bullhead, Bowfin, Common Carp, Green Sunfish, Largemouth Bass, Pumpkinseed, Tiger Muskellunge, White Crappie, White Sucker, Yellow Bullhead, and Yellow Perch.  <br> \n</p>",

Other species found to be abundant were black bullheads, white suckers, and white crappies. Each of these species was below average in weight. The only species found to be of average weight was the one largemouth bass captured.</p>",
