                "narrative": "<p>Namakan Lake is part of the Namakan Resevoir that includes Kabetogama, Sand point, Crane, and Little Vermilion lakes.  Gill netting is conducted annually in Namakan Lake to assess fish populations.The walleye catch was 4.9/gill net, which was the lowest catch in the last 11 years.  However, it was still within the normal range for this type of lake.  The low catch rate may have been a result of three consecutive weak year classes.  However, the 1994 year class appeared to be very strong, and should provide good angling opportunities for the next few years.  The average size of walleye was 13.2\", and the largest walleye observed was 21.9\".Sauger catch rate was also low for Namakan Lake at 1.8/gill net.  Age class distribution was similar to that for walleye, and probably contributed to the low catch rate.  Sauger averaged 11.1\".  Growth rates for both walleye and sauger in Namakan Lake were lower than the state averages for those species.Northern pike catch rate was average for this lake type at 1.6 per gill net.  The pike tended to be fairly large.  The average length was 25.3\", and the average weight was 4.2 lbs.  Approximately 13% of the pike were longer than 34\".Forage species included yellow perch, tullibee, and white sucker. Catch rates for these three species were within the normal ranges.  Other species sampled in low numbers included lake sturgeon, smallmouth bass, black crappie, rock bass, black bullhead, and burbot, and redhorse.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Namakan Lake is located on the border between Minnesota and the Province of Ontario and is part of the Namakan Reservoir, which also consists of Crane, Kabetogama, Little Vermilion, and Sand Point lakes.  There is no road access to several of the lakes.  Thus, anglers gain access by traveling by boat from road access points located on Crane or Kabetogama lakes.   <br> \n <br> \nBlack crappie abundance was below the expected range for this lake type; which is different from recent years, when crappie abundance exceeded expectation.  Black crappie fishing has become more popular recently on Namakan Lake, especially in winter.  Most anglers have been attracted by the large crappies present in Namakan Lake.  The largest crappie captured during the 2010 fisheries investigation was 9.7 inches.   <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike abundance was within the expected range for this lake type.  Abundance has increased 35 percent since 2000; the year which the rule-curve used to regulate water levels was changed to enhance northern pike spawning habitat.  Size remains impressive and anglers have a good chance to catch very large northern pike.  Our sample in 2010 found fish up to 40.1 inches.    <br> \n <br> \nSauger are present but generally are rare and sizes are small.  The average size sampled in 2010 was 10.1 inches and the average weight was 0.27 pounds.   <br> \n <br> \nSmallmouth bass is another choice for anglers visiting Namakan Lake.  Abundance in 2010 was within the expected range for this lake type.  The average size in our sample was 12.4 inches, a fun size for anglers.  Typically, anglers also catch some very large fish while targeting smallmouth bass on Namakan Lake.  Some true trophy-sized fish are out there.   <br> \n <br> \nWalleye abundance was within the expected range for this lake type.  Size in the sample ranged from 6.6-23.3 inches. Walleye ranged from 0-16 years old and age-4 fish represented 37 percent of the sample.  The walleye born in 2006 are the third strongest year-class in the past 25 years.  These fish will continue to grow larger and provide opportunities for great fishing in the future.     <br> \n <br> \nYellow perch abundance was near the top of the expected range for this lake type.  However, sizes in this lake type are generally small.  Although yellow perch are unlikely to interest most angers, they are important forage for predators.  </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Namakan Lake is a 25,130 acre, class 2 lake, located along the border between Minnesota and the Province of Ontario.  The Minnesota portion (12,314 acres) is located in Voyageurs National Park.  Namakan Lake is part of the Namakan Reservoir, which also includes Crane, Kabetogama, Little Vermilion, and Sand Point lakes.  There is no road access on the Minnesota portion of Namakan Lake.  Thus, anglers gain access by traveling by boat from road access points located on Crane or Kabetogama lakes.       Black bullheads, black crappies, cisco, golden shiners, lake sturgeon, lake whitefish, northern pike, rock bass, saugers, smallmouth bass, walleyes, white suckers, and yellow perch were captured in gill nets in 2000.            Northern pike gill net abundance was slightly above average compared to similar lakes (class 2).  Six year-classes were present and age ranged from 1-6 years.  Total length ranged from 20.9-39.0 inches, and growth was much higher than the statewide and area averages.  Average weight was also higher than similar lakes.       Walleye gill net abundance was near the average for this lake type.  However, overall walleye abundance was down 56% from the 1999 population assessment and fish from the 1996 year-class were down 78%.  In 1999, 156 walleyes from the 1996 year-class were captured; the number dropped to 35 in 2000.  The change in abundance was mostly due to the large 1996 year-class of fish moving into the unprotected zone of the slot limit on Namamkan Lake and the subsequent angling harvest prior to our population assessment.       In 2000, nine walleye year-classes were present and age ranged from 1-11 years.  Strong year-classes were produced in 1994, 1996, and 1998.  Total length ranged from 6.8-23.3 inches and the mean was 13.7.  Growth was less than the area and statewide averages.  Mean weight of walleyes was similar to other class 2 lakes.      Yellow perch gill net abundance was above average for class 2 lakes.  Six year-classes were present and age ranged from 2-7 years.  Age-3 fish composed 50% of the sample.  Total length ranged from 5.1-9.6 inches and the mean was 7.2.  Growth was the same as lakes in this area, but below the statewide average.   </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Namakan Lake is a 25,130 acre, class 2 lake, located along the border between Minnesota and the Province of Ontario.  The Minnesota portion (12,314 acres) is located in Voyageurs National Park.  Namakan Lake is part of the Namakan Reservoir, which also consists of Crane, Kabetogama, Little Vermilion, and Sand Point lakes.  There is no road access on the Minnesota portion of Namakan Lake.  Thus, most anglers gain access by traveling by boat or snowmobile from road access points located on Crane or Kabetogama lakes.       Northern pike gill-net abundance was 1.70 fish/set, which was slightly above the median of 1.62 fish/set for class 2 lakes.  Eight year-classes were present and age ranged from 1-10 years.  Total length (TL) ranged from 12.6-36.0 inches.  The growth rate was much higher than the statewide average.  The mean weight was above the median for class 2 lakes.       Walleye gill-net abundance was 9.90 fish/set, which was above last year's level of 6.00 fish/set and the median of 6.32 fish/set for lake class 2.  Thirteen year-classes were present and age ranged from 0-13 years.  The 1998 year-class represented 41% of the sample.  Total length ranged from 4.4-22.8 inches and the mean was 13.7.  Growth was slower than the area and statewide averages.  Mean weight of walleyes was the same as the median for class 2 lakes.       Yellow perch gill-net abundance was 3.50 fish/set, which was below the median of 4.53 fish/set for class 2 lakes.  Five year-classes were present and age ranged from 2-6 years.  Age-4 fish were the most common and represented 43% of the sample.  Total length ranged from 5.5-10.1 inches and the mean was 7.3.  Growth was the same as the area average, but below the statewide average.   </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Namakan Lake is a 25,130 acre, class 2 lake, located along the border between Minnesota and the Province of Ontario.  The Minnesota portion (12,314 acres) is located in Voyageurs National Park.  Namakan Lake is part of the Namakan Reservoir, which also consists of Crane, Kabetogama, Little Vermilion, and Sand Point lakes.  There is no road access on the Minnesota portion of Namakan Lake.  Thus, anglers gain access by traveling by boat from road access points located on Crane or Kabetogama lakes.       The fish community in Namakan Lake is diverse with many species present.  Black crappies, cisco, lake sturgeon, lake whitefish, northern pike, rock bass, saugers, silver redhorse, smallmouth bass, walleyes, white suckers, and yellow perch were captured in during the assessment in 2004.            Black crappie gill-net abundance was 0.20 fish/set, which was the lowest level recorded since 1996.  Total length (TL) ranged from 4.1-8.5 inches and the mean was 5.7.  The mean weight was below what is found in most class 2 lakes.       Northern pike gill-net abundance (1.50 fish/set) was slightly below the median for class 2 lakes (1.62 fish/set).  Six year-classes were present and age ranged from 2-9 years.  Maximum size was exceptional; total length ranged from 17.9-42.3 inches and the mean was 25.7.  Growth was also outstanding; the mean TL at age-4 of 25.4 inches was much higher than the statewide mean of 21.1 inches and the area mean of 23.7 inches.  The mean weight was above the third quartile for class 2 lakes.       Walleye gill-net abundance was 8.85 fish/set, which was above the lake class median of 6.32.  Thirteen year-classes were present and age ranged from 1-17 years.  Age-3 fish represented 30% of the sample.  Total length ranged from 7.0-27.5 inches and the mean was 14.8.  Walleye growth was slow in Namakan; mean TL at age-4 was 11.3 inches, well below the area (14.4) and statewide (15.1) averages.  Mean weight of walleyes was greater than the third quartile for class 2 lakes.       Yellow perch gill-net abundance was 3.65 fish/set, which was below the median for class 2 lakes.  Six year-classes were present and age ranged from 2-7 years.  Age-3 fish represented 60% of the sample.  Total length ranged from 5.2-10.8 inches and the mean was 6.6.  Mean TL at age-4 was 6.6 inches, which was equal to the area average, but below the statewide average of 7.2 inches.   </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Namakan Lake is located on the border between Minnesota and the Province of Ontario and is part of the Namakan Reservoir, which also consists of Crane, Kabetogama, Little Vermilion, and Sand Point lakes.  There is no road access to several of the lakes.  Thus, anglers gain access by traveling by boat from road access points located on Crane or Kabetogama lakes.   <br> \n <br> \nBlack Crappie abundance was within the expected range for this lake type.  Black Crappie fishing has become more popular recently on Namakan Lake, especially in winter.  Most anglers have been attracted by the large Crappies present in Namakan Lake.  The largest Crappie captured during the 2014 fisheries investigation was 11.7 inches.   <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike abundance was within the expected range for this lake type.  The rule-curve used to regulate water levels was changed in 2000 to enhance Northern Pike spawning habitat.  Long-term trends suggest that the change in water levels has improved Northern Pike abundance.  Size remains impressive and anglers have a good chance to catch very large Northern Pike.  The sample in 2014 included fish up to 41.4 inches.   <br> \n <br> \nSauger are present but generally not abundant and sizes are small.  The average size sampled in 2014 was 10.2 inches and the average weight was 0.28 pounds.   <br> \n <br> \nSmallmouth Bass is another choice for anglers visiting Namakan Lake.  Abundance in 2014 was well above the expected range for this lake type.  The average size in our sample was 11.9 inches, a fun size for anglers.  Typically, anglers also catch some very large fish while targeting Smallmouth Bass on Namakan Lake.   <br> \n <br> \nWalleye abundance was within the expected range for this lake type.  Long-term trends indicate at least a 10 percent increase in Walleye abundance since a size regulation was implemented in 1998.  The regulation has also improved the size structure; older, larger fish are now more abundant.  In 2014, 15 year-classes were present and age ranged from 1-19 years.  The 2006 year-class was the strongest in over 25 years and remains prominent, representing 13 percent of the sample in 2014.  Recent year-classes look promising as well, especially the 2011 year-class which represented 39 percent of the sample.  Size in the 2014 sample ranged from 4.6-31.0 inches and mean weight was 1.12 pounds. <br> \n <br> \nYellow Perch abundance was within the expected range for this lake type.  Currently, sizes exist that are attractive to anglers.  The size range was from 5.2-11.6 inches and the mean was 7.4.  </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Namakan Lake is located approximately thirty miles east-southeast of International Falls, Minnesota on the international border between Minnesota and Ontario, Canada. Namakan is part of the Namakan Reservoir, which also consists of Kabetogama, Sand Point, Crane, and Little Vermilion lakes. The reservoir system typically consists of dark stained waters with low densities of vegetation and an abundance of rock. The Minnesota portion of Namakan lies within Voyageurs National Park, and does not have a road access. Anglers can access Namakan by boat from road access points located on Crane or Kabetogama lakes, or through a network of snowmobile trails in winter. Namakan has high quality populations of several species of gamefish, and is typically surveyed annually to monitor those fish populations.    <br> \n <br> \nBlack Crappie are not typically caught in great numbers in the sampling gear used to survey Namakan each year. Crappie catch rates in 2018 were equal to what would be expected in lakes similar to Namakan, and the average size was slightly larger than what would be expected. Black Crappie averaged 8.5 inches and some over 11 inches were in the sample.  <br> \n <br> \nCisco are an important forage species for larger predator fish. Catch rates in 2018 were up from the 2017 survey, but still slightly less than the average catch rate for Namakan. Cisco ranged from about 7 to 18 inches.  <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike catch rates were similar to the historic average for Namakan. There is always potential to catch a trophy fish here. Pike caught during the 2018 survey ranged from 15 to 41 inches, and averaged 4.25 pounds. Ages from Northern Pike ranged from 1 to 10 years old.  <br> \n <br> \nSauger catch rates were close to the long term average for Namakan. Sauger do not typically reach large sizes in Namakan, but can provide some bonus fillets for anglers targeting fish for harvest. The average Sauger sampled in 2018 was 10 inches.  <br> \n <br> \nSmallmouth Bass catch rates were within the expected range for Namakan. Average size was greater than what would be expected for similar lakes. Smallmouth ranged from approximately 9 to 17 inches and averaged 13 to 14 inches.   <br> \n <br> \nWalleye catch rates were up from 2017, and greater than the historic mean for Namakan. Anglers targeting harvestable size Walleye have ample opportunities to do so as the average size was just under 14 inches. Fairly consistent year class production also means that a wide range of sizes are available to anglers, including trophy sized fish. The 2011 year class remains the strongest in recent history.  <br> \n <br> \nYellow Perch catch rates were also near the historic mean for Namakan, which is slightly more than average for similar lakes. The average size of Yellow Perch in Namakan is also greater than would be expected for similar lakes. The average length in 2018 was over 8 inches and fish over 12 inches were in the sample. Perch up to 11 years old were aged, but the 2 to 6 year olds made up over 90% of the catch.  <br> \n <br> \nOther fish caught during the 2018 survey included Burbot, Lake Sturgeon, Lake Whitefish, Redhorse, Rock Bass, and White Sucker. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Namakan Lake is a 25,130 acre, softwater lake, located along the border between Minnesota and the Province of Ontario. The lake has a rocky irregular shoreline and tannin stained water typical of Canadian Shield lakes.  The Minnesota portion (12,322 acres) is located within the boundaries of Voyageurs National Park. Namakan Lake is part of the Namakan Reservoir, which also includes Crane, Kabetogama, Little Vermilion and Sand Point lakes. There is no road access on the Minnesota side of the lake. Thus, most anglers gain access by traveling via boat or snowmobile from road access points located on Crane or Kabetogama Lakes.  A mechanical portage does exist at Kettle Falls located where Namakan flows into the east end of Rainy Lake.Twelve species were present in the 2005 Fall Assessment gill netting on Namakan Lake.  Cisco was the most common species in the catch making up 28% of the total by number. Yellow perch, walleye and northern pike were also common.  Northern pike had the highest total weight in the catch.Walleye abundance in 2005 (5.70/net) was the lowest recorded since 1997 on Namakan Lake. In spite of the low abundance recorded this year, gill-net abundance has shown an increasing trend since sampling was standardized in 1983 and, in recent years, has become more stable.  The abundance of walleye over 17 inches in length also appears to be increasing.  Lengths of walleye averaged 14.6 inches with the largest individual measuring 26.7 inches. Walleye growth for Namakan Lake was slower than the Area and Statewide averages.Fourteen year-classes were present in the walleye catch and ages ranged from 0-22 years. Most walleye were from the 2001 year-class (27% of captured walleye) and the 1999 year-class (18% of captured walleye).  Fewer age-5 (2000 year-class) and age-3 (2002 year-class) walleye were captured than is normal for these age-groups.  More year-classes are reaching maturity than ever before.   Northern pike abundance (2.40/net) exceeded the median of 1.62/net for lakes of this classification.  The 2005 northern pike gill-net catch also was the third highest of all previous fisheries investigations on Namakan Lake.  High abundance in 2005 was consistent with the positive trend in pike abundance noted since the early 1990's.  Lengths of captured northern pike ranged from 16.4 to 38.6 inches with an average of 25.2 inches.  Four pike over 36 inches in length were reported in the catch.  The average weight for captured northern pike (4.26 pounds) exceeded the average for this lake class (3.52 pounds).  Growth of Namakan Lake northern pike was considerably faster than the Area median.  The 2001 year-class appears to be strong in number.Although gill-net catches of smallmouth bass on Namakan Lake tend to be variable, they do indicate that bass abundance has increased since the early 1960's.  The 2005 gill-net catch (0.50/net) was the eighth highest on record for Namakan Lake and exceeded the median for this lake class.  The nine bass caught during this investigation averaged 12.3 in length. Growth of Namakan Lake smallmouth bass exceeded the Area median. Other species present in the gill-net catch included black crappie, burbot, lake whitefish, rock bass, sauger, silver lamprey, cisco and white sucker.   </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Namakan Lake is located on the border between Minnesota and the Province of Ontario and is part of the Namakan Reservoir, which also consists of Crane, Kabetogama, Little Vermilion, and Sand Point lakes.  There is no road access to several of the lakes.  Thus, anglers gain access by traveling by boat from road access points located on Crane or Kabetogama lakes.   <br> \n <br> \nBlack crappie abundance was within the expected range for this lake type and has been for many years.  However, black crappie fishing has become more popular recently on Namakan Lake, especially in winter.  Most anglers have been attracted by the large crappies present in Namakan Lake.  The largest crappie captured during the fisheries investigation was 10.7 inches.   <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike abundance was within the expected range for this lake type.  Anglers have a good chance to catch a very large northern pike.  Our sample found fish up to 37.7 inches.    <br> \n <br> \nSauger are present but generally are rare and sizes are small.  The average size sampled in 2009 was 10.3 inches and the average weight was 0.31 pounds.   <br> \n <br> \nSmallmouth bass is another choice for anglers visiting Namakan Lake.  Abundance in 2009 was higher than the expected range for this lake type.  The average size in our sample was 12.6 inches, a fun size for anglers.  Typically, anglers also catch some very large fish while targeting smallmouth bass on Namakan Lake.  Some true trophy-sized fish are out there.   <br> \n <br> \nWalleye abundance was within the expected range for this lake type.  Size in the sample ranged from 7.2-24.0 inches. Walleye ranged from 1-13 years old and age-3 fish represented 61 percent of the sample.  The walleye born in 2006 are the third strongest year-class in the past 25 years.  These fish will grow a little larger in the near future and provide an excellent fishing opportunity.     <br> \n <br> \nYellow perch abundance was higher than the expected range for this lake type.  However, sizes were small and no fish over 9 inches were captured.  Although yellow perch are unlikely to interest most angers, they are important forage for predators.  </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Namakan Lake is located on the border between Minnesota and the Province of Ontario and is part of the Namakan Reservoir, which also consists of Crane, Kabetogama, Little Vermilion, and Sand Point lakes.  There is no road access to several of the lakes.  Thus, anglers gain access by traveling by boat from road access points located on Crane or Kabetogama lakes.   <br> \n <br> \nBlack Crappie abundance was within the expected range for this lake type.  Black Crappie fishing has become more popular recently on Namakan Lake, especially in winter.  Most anglers have been attracted by the large Crappies present in Namakan Lake.  The largest Crappie captured during the 2013 fisheries investigation was 10.0 inches.   <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike abundance was slightly above the expected range for this lake type.  The rule-curve used to regulate water levels was changed in 2000 to enhance Northern Pike spawning habitat.  Long-term trends suggest that the change in water levels has improved Northern Pike abundance.  Size remains impressive and anglers have a good chance to catch very large Northern Pike.  The sample in 2013 included fish up to 43.0 inches.   <br> \n <br> \nSauger are present but generally not abundant and sizes are small.  The average size sampled in 2013 was 10.6 inches and the average weight was 0.32 pounds.   <br> \n <br> \nSmallmouth Bass is another choice for anglers visiting Namakan Lake.  Abundance in 2013 was well above the expected range for this lake type.  The average size in our sample was 11.7 inches, a fun size for anglers.  Typically, anglers also catch some very large fish while targeting Smallmouth Bass on Namakan Lake.   <br> \n <br> \nWalleye abundance was within the expected range for this lake type.  Long-term trends indicate at least a 10 percent increase in Walleye abundance since a size regulation was implemented in 1998.  The regulation has also improved the size structure; older, larger fish are now more abundant.  In 2013, 15 year-classes were present and age ranged from 1-19 years.  The 2006 year-class was the strongest in over 25 years and remains prominent, representing 21 percent of the sample in 2013.  Recent year-classes look promising as well, especially the 2011 year-class which represented 27 percent of the sample.  Size in the 2013 sample ranged from 7.3-24.1 inches and mean weight was 0.98 pounds. <br> \n <br> \nYellow Perch abundance was within the expected range for this lake type.  Currently, sizes exist that are attractive to anglers.  The size range was from 5.4-11.3 inches and the mean was 7.2.  </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Namakan Lake is located on the border between Minnesota and the Province of Ontario and is part of the Namakan Reservoir, which also consists of Crane, Kabetogama, Little Vermilion, and Sand Point lakes.  There is no road access to several of the lakes.  Thus, anglers gain access by traveling by boat from road access points located on Crane or Kabetogama lakes.   <br> \n <br> \nBlack Crappie abundance was within the expected range for this lake type.  Black Crappie fishing has become more popular recently on Namakan Lake, especially in winter.  Most anglers have been attracted by the large Crappies present in Namakan Lake.  The largest Crappie captured during the 2015 fisheries investigation was 11.9 inches.   <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike abundance was within the expected range for this lake type.  The rule-curve used to regulate water levels was changed in 2000 to enhance Northern Pike spawning habitat.  Long-term trends suggest that the change in water levels has improved Northern Pike abundance.  Size remains impressive and anglers have a good chance to catch very large Northern Pike.  The sample in 2015 included fish up to 41.8 inches.   <br> \n <br> \nSauger are present but generally not abundant and sizes are small.  The average size sampled in 2015 was 10.0 inches and the average weight was 0.27 pounds.   <br> \n <br> \nSmallmouth Bass is another choice for anglers visiting Namakan Lake.  Abundance in 2015 was well above the expected range for this lake type.  The average size in our sample was 12.3 inches, a fun size for anglers.  Typically, anglers also catch some very large fish while targeting Smallmouth Bass on Namakan Lake.   <br> \n <br> \nWalleye abundance was within the expected range for this lake type.  Long-term trends indicate at least a 10 percent increase in Walleye abundance since a size regulation was implemented in 1998.  The regulation has also improved the size structure; older, larger fish are now more abundant.  In 2015, 15 year-classes were present and age ranged from 1-21 years.  The 2006 year-class was the strongest in over 25 years and remains prominent.  Recent year-classes look promising as well, especially the 2011 and 2012 year-classes which represented 58 percent of the sample.  Size in the 2015 sample ranged from 7.0-26.2 inches and average weight was 0.87 pounds. <br> \n <br> \nYellow Perch abundance was above the expected range for this lake type.  Currently, sizes exist that are attractive to anglers.  The size range was from 4.5-11.8 inches and the average was 7.5.  </p>",

This is consistent with previous investigations on Namakan Lake.  Although walleye up to 27\" long were sampled in gillnets, the average length was 13.2\", and average weight was 1.0 pounds.  These averages are probably influenced by relatively slow growth rates of walleye in Namakan Lake, and a lack of walleye ages 5 and older.     Northern pike abundance as sampled by test nets is lower than what is typically observed on similar lakes, which indicates a low density northern pike population.  However, the northern pike in Namakan Lake are fast growing and large, with an average length of 27.3\" and an average weight of 5.8 pounds.     Sauger gillnet catch rates are less than what is normally observed in similar lakes in the International Falls area.  This is a departure from recent investigations, and suggests a decline in sauger abundance has occurred.  The average length of sauger sampled in gillnets was 9.7\", and average weight was 0.2 pounds.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Namakan Lake is part of the Namakan Reservoir that includes Kabetogama, Sand Point, Crane and Little Vermilion Lakes.  Assessment netting is conducted annually in Namakan Lake to investigate the fish community.  Experimental regulations, establishing a walleye harvest slot of 13 to 17 inches with one walleye over 23 inches, became effective in March of 1998.     The walleye catch was 9.2/gill net, which was near the upper level of the normal range for this type of lake.  The 1994 and 1996 year classes appeared to be very strong and should provide good angling opportunities for the next few years.  The average walleye measured 12.2 inches with a few fish over 23 inches.  Sauger catch rate was low for Namakan Lake at 1.6/gill net.  The average sauger measured 9.8 inches.  Growth rate for both walleye and sauger were below statewide averages for these species.     Northern pike catch rate was typical for this type of lake at 2.3/ gill net.  The average northern pike measured 23.8 inches with a few fish over 30 inches.  Forage species sampled in 1998 included yellow perch, white sucker and tullibee.  Catch rates for these species were near the upper level of the normal range for lakes like Namakan.  Other species sampled in low numbers included lake sturgeon, lake whitefish, smallmouth bass, black crappie, rock bass and burbot.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Namakan Lake is part of the Namakan Reservoir that includes Kabetogama, Sand Point, Crane and Little Vermilion Lakes.  Assessment netting is conducted annually in Namakan Lake to investigate the fish community.  Experimental regulations, establishing a walleye harvest slot of 13 to 17 inches with one walleye over 23 inches, became effective in March 1998.     The walleye catch was 13.8 per net, which was above the upper level of the normal range for this type of lake.  The 1996 year class appeared to be very strong and should provide good angling opportunities for the next few years.  The average walleye measured 13.5 inches.  Sauger catch rate was low for Namakan Lake at 1.4 per net.  The average sauger measured 10.7 inches.  Growth rate for both walleye and sauger were below area and statewide averages for these species.     Northern pike catch rate was typical for this type of lake at 2.4 per net.  The average northern pike measured 25.7 inches with several fish over 30 inches.  Forage species sampled in 1999 included yellow perch, white sucker and tullibee.  Catch rates for these species were near the upper level of the normal range for lakes like Namakan.  Other species sampled in low numbers included: lake whitefish, smallmouth bass, black crappie, rock bass, pumpkinseed, and burbot.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Namakan Lake is located approximately thirty miles east-southeast of International Falls, Minnesota on the international border between Minnesota and Ontario, Canada. Namakan is part of the Namakan Reservoir, which also consists of Kabetogama, Sand Point, Crane, and Little Vermilion lakes. The reservoir system typically consists of dark stained waters with low densities of vegetation and an abundance of rock. The Minnesota portion of Namakan lies within Voyageurs National Park, and does not have a road access. Anglers can access Namakan by boat from road access points located on Crane or Kabetogama lakes, or through a network of snowmobile trails in winter. Namakan has high quality populations of several species of gamefish, and is typically surveyed annually to monitor those fish populations.    <br> \n <br> \nAlthough commonly known for its large predator fish, Namakan also supports populations of panfish. Black Crappie catch rates in 2017 were within the expected range for lakes similar to Namakan, and were near the long term average for the lake. Crappies over ten inches were sampled. Bluegill are also present in low numbers.  <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike catch rates were within the expected range for this lake class, and similar to the historical average for Namakan. The lake holds a low density population with good trophy potential. The largest Northern Pike sampled in 2017 was a 44.7 inch female estimated to be 12 years old. <br> \n <br> \nSauger were also caught at rates within the expected range for Namakan. Sauger in Namakan typically do not reach large sizes, but can provide another option for table fare. The average size sampled in 2017 was 10.6 inches and fish over 15 inches were present.   <br> \n <br> \nSmallmouth Bass catch rates in 2017 were well above the normal range for lakes similar to Namakan, and more than double the historical average for the lake. The average size was approximately 13.4 inches and 1.4 pounds. Over half of the Smallmouth Bass sampled were from a strong 2012 year class.  <br> \n <br> \nWalleye catch rates were within the expected range for Namakan, and nearly identical to the historical average. Walleye provide good angling opportunities with average fish sampled in 2017 being approximately 13.2 inches. There is also potential to encounter trophy fish in Namakan. Walleye recruitment is fairly consistent, with fish from nearly every year class over the past 15 years present in the 2017 sample.  <br> \n <br> \nYellow Perch catch rates were also within the expected range. The average size in the 2017 sample was 7.7 inches, and fish over 11 inches were present. <br> \n  <br> \nOther fish caught during the 2017 survey included Burbot, Cisco, Lake Sturgeon, Pumpkinseed Sunfish, Redhorse, Rock Bass, and White Sucker.  <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Namakan Lake is located approximately thirty miles east-southeast of International Falls, Minnesota on the international border between Minnesota and Ontario, Canada. Namakan is part of the Namakan Reservoir, which also consists of Kabetogama, Sand Point, Crane, and Little Vermilion lakes. The reservoir system typically consists of dark stained waters with little vegetation and an abundance of rock. The Minnesota portion of Namakan is 11,755 acres that lie entirely within Voyageurs National Park. There is no road access, but anglers can get to Namakan by boat from road access points located on Crane or Kabetogama lakes, or by portage from Rainy Lake. Namakan has high quality populations of several species of gamefish that are monitored annually with a fall gill netting survey.  <br> \n <br> \nThe 2019 catch rate for Black Crappie was average for this type of lake. Crappies from 2 to 8 years old were sampled, and the maximum size was 14 inches. Anglers who can locate these fish should enjoy a variety of sizes and the potential to catch some very large fish.  <br> \n <br> \nCisco are an important forage species in Namakan. The 2019 catch rate for Cisco was greater than the historic average for this lake. Sizes ranged from 6 to 19 inches. A similar species, Lake Whitefish, are also found in Namakan. Lake Whitefish had an average size of about 20 inches during this survey.  <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike catch rates were above average in 2019, and the average size was down from previous surveys. A strong 2016 year class (age 3) made up nearly half of the sample, and these mostly ranged from 18 to 22 inches. The maximum size was over 39 inches. Namakan is typically regarded as a high quality Northern Pike lake, with most surveys producing multiple fish over 40 inches.  <br> \n <br> \nSauger catches in 2019 were above the historic average for Namakan. The average size was also bigger than what would be expected for this type of lake. The average size was just over 10 inches, and some Sauger over 15 inches were caught. Nine year classes were caught, with Sauger up to 13 years old in the sample. A strong 2015 year class made up 43% of the catch.  <br> \n  <br> \nBass are not typically sampled in high numbers in nets. However, the abundance of these fish in Namakan produced a good sample in the gill nets in 2019. The Smallmouth Bass catch rate was above average, and the size structure is good. The average size in 2019 was just over 12 inches, and the maximum size was over 17 inches. Ages ranged from 2 to 8 years old, and a strong 2015 year class made up over half of the catch.  <br> \n <br> \nWalleye catch rates were down in 2019, but still average in comparison to similar lakes. Average sizes were also within the expected range for Namakan. Sizes ranged from 6 to 24 inches with an average of about 13 inches. Walleye ages ranged from 0 to 20 years old. The 2011 and 2012 year classes are the strongest recent year classes, although there are a good number of younger Walleye available to anglers.  <br> \n <br> \nYellow Perch catch rates were also within the expected range for Namakan. These are an important forage species for larger predators. However, the sizes available in Namakan should also be of interest to many anglers. The average size in 2019 was over 7 inches, and the largest were nearly 11 inches. Ages ranged from 2 to 10 years. There was an abundance of 2 to 3 year olds caught in this survey. Those year classes made up the majority of the sample.  <br> \n <br> \nOther species sampled in the 2019 survey included Burbot, Lake Sturgeon, Pumpkinseed, Redhorse, Rock Bass, Silver Lamprey, and White Sucker.  <br> \n</p>",

The 1994 year class looked very strong, and should provide anglers with walleye from 12 to 16 inches in 1997.Northern pike abundance remained close to the historical average for Namakan Lake.  The mean length and weight were 20.5 inches and 3.9 lbs.  Over half of the northern pike sampled in 1996 were age 2.  Sauger abundance remained within the normal range for this lake class, with an average size of 10.1 inches.  Catches of yellow perch, smallmouth bass, tullibee, and white sucker were within normal ranges for lakes similar to Namakan Lake.   </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Namakan Lake is located on the border between Minnesota and the Province of Ontario and is part of the Namakan Reservoir, which also consists of Crane, Kabetogama, Little Vermilion, and Sand Point lakes.  There is no road access to several of the lakes.  Thus, anglers gain access by traveling by boat from road access points located on Crane or Kabetogama lakes.   <br> \n <br> \nBlack crappie abundance was better than the expected range for this lake type.  Black crappie fishing has become more popular recently on Namakan Lake, especially in winter.  Most anglers have been attracted by the large crappies present in Namakan Lake.  However, the largest crappie captured during the 2012 fisheries investigation was 7.9 inches, which is much smaller than what has been captured in recent years.   <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike abundance was at the upper end of the expected range for this lake type.  The rule-curve used to regulate water levels was changed in 2000 to enhance northern pike spawning habitat.  Long-term trends suggest that the change in water levels has improved northern pike abundance.  Size remains impressive and anglers have a good chance to catch very large northern pike.  The sample in 2012 included fish up to 44.2 inches.   <br> \n <br> \nSauger are present but generally are rare and sizes are small.  The average size sampled in 2012 was 10.4 inches and the average weight was 0.31 pounds.   <br> \n <br> \nSmallmouth bass is another choice for anglers visiting Namakan Lake.  Abundance in 2012 was above the expected range for this lake type.  The average size in our sample was 13.1 inches, a fun size for anglers.  Typically, anglers also catch some very large fish while targeting smallmouth bass on Namakan Lake.   <br> \n <br> \nWalleye abundance was above the expected range for this lake type.  Long-term trends indicate at least a 10 percent increase in walleye abundance since a size regulation was implemented in 1998.  The regulation has also improved the size structure; older, larger fish are now more abundant.  In 2012, 14 year-classes were present and age ranged from 0-16 years.  The 2006 year-class was the third strongest in over 25 years and remains prominent, representing 33 percent of the sample in 2012.  The 2008 year-class was also strong and represented 18 percent of the sample.  Recent year-classes look promising as well.  Size in the 2012 sample ranged from 4.9-22.6 inches and mean weight was 0.98 pounds. <br> \n <br> \nYellow perch abundance was within the expected range for this lake type.  Currently, sizes exist that are attractive to anglers.  The size range was from 5.4-11.8 inches and the mean was 7.3.  </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Namakan Lake is a class 2 lake located on the Minnesota-Ontario border within Voyageurs National Park (VNP). The total surface area is 24,066 acres of which 49% or 11,755 acres lie within Minnesota. Namakan Lake is typical of lakes within the Canadian Shield with soft, oligotrophic water and intermediate productivity. The mean depth is 45 feet, with a maximum-recorded depth of 150 feet. Only 20% of the lake is less than 15 feet deep (littoral zone), although its shoreline stretches for more than 146 miles. Namakan Lake is part of the Namakan Reservoir, which also includes Kabetogama, Sand Point, Crane, and Little Vermilion lakes. Namakan Lake has road access on the Canadian side (Namakan River via Flanders Road), but access on the Minnesota side is by water only. A mechanical portage from Rainy Lake is available at Kettle Falls. The nearest road access on the Minnesota side is located on the east end of Kabetogama Lake at Voyageurs National Park's Ash River Visitor Center. Namakan has been sampled annually since 1983. <br> \n <br> \nCurrent fishing regulations on Namakan Lake follow the border waters (Canada-Minnesota) regulations. For Walleye and Sauger, the limit is six (not more than four can be Walleye), Walleye from 18\"-26\" must be immediately released, and only one Walleye over 26\" allowed in possession limit. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye gill-net catch rate was 5.8 fish per net which is below average for similar lakes. The catch rate is below the management goal of 6.3 fish per net for Namakan Lake, but within the range of normal. Total length ranged from 6.9 to 27.1 inches and mean length was 13.6 inches. Mean weight was 1.1 pounds which is above average for similar class lakes. A total of 12 year classes were present and ages ranged from 1 to 16 years. Overall, there are good numbers of Walleyes in Namakan Lake, with the chance to catch Walleye over 26 inches. Namakan Lake offers a good Walleye fishing opportunity. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike gill-net catch rate was 3.1 fish per net, well above average for similar lakes. Total length ranged from 13.4 to 40.9 inches and the mean length was 24.0 inches. The mean weight was 3.6 pounds which is average for similar lakes. A total of 10 year classes were present, and ages ranged from 1 to 10. Northern Pike have had strong year classes since 2010. Namakan Lake offers a low-density Northern Pike population, but an excellent opportunity to catch a trophy fish.  <br> \n <br> \nSauger gill-net catch rate was 2.1 fish per net which is below average for similar lakes. Total length ranged from 8.1 to 13.5 inches and the mean length was 10.4 inches. Mean weight was 0.3 pounds which is well below average for similar class lakes. A total of eight year classes were present, and ages ranged from 2 to 12. The 2015 and 2019-year classes are strong year class compared to recent years. Sauger provides additional harvest opportunity for anglers.  <br> \n <br> \nYellow Perch gill-net catch rate was 8.9 fish per net which is above average for similar lakes. Total length ranged from 5.2 to 10.6 inches and the mean length was 6.8 inches. The mean weight of 0.2 pounds was average for similar lakes. A total of six year classes were present in the sample and ages ranged from 2 to 7 years. Yellow Perch offer an additional fishing opportunity and forage for Walleye and Northern Pike.  <br> \n <br> \nSmallmouth Bass gill-net catch rate was 1.0 fish per net, above average for similar lakes. Total length ranged from 9.0 to 16.5 inches and the mean length was 12.8 inches. The mean weight of 1.2 pounds was above average for similar lakes. A total of five years classes were present in the sample and ages ranged from 3 to 8 years. There are decent numbers of Smallmouth Bass in Namakan Lake, with the opportunity to catch a quality fish. <br> \n <br> \nBlack Crappie gill-net catch rate was 0.4 fish per net which is average for similar lakes. Total lengths ranged from 6.4 to 10.6 inches, and the mean length was 8.8 inches. The mean weight of 0.4 pounds was average for similar lakes. A total of two year classes were present, and ages ranged from 2 to 3 years. Black Crappie offer an additional fishing opportunity in Namakan Lake. <br> \n <br> \n</p>",

This is similar to past investigations of Namakan Lake.  Walleye up to 23.7\" were sampled, with an average length of 13.4\", and an average weight of 1.0 pounds.  Although walleye up to 9 years old were sampled, the population continues to be dominated by fish ages 6 or less.  The 1994 year-class appears strong, which could provide increased angling opportunities for walleye in the 10\" to 14\" size range during 1996.Northern pike abundance has increased slightly, due to the presence of a strong 1993 year-class.  This decreased the average size of those sampled to 3.4 pounds, however, one northern pike measured was 35.9\" long, and weighed 10.2 pounds.Sauger abundance remains within the normal range for similar lakes, with an average length of 11.2\".  Yellow perch, tullibee, white sucker, smallmouth bass, and rock bass were all sampled in numbers commonly reported for these species in similar lakes.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Namakan Lake is located approximately thirty miles east-southeast of International Falls, Minnesota on the international border between Minnesota and Ontario, Canada. Namakan is part of the Namakan Reservoir, which also consists of Kabetogama, Sand Point, Crane, and Little Vermilion lakes. The reservoir system typically consists of dark stained waters with little vegetation and an abundance of rock. The Minnesota portion of Namakan is 11,755 acres that lie entirely within Voyageurs National Park. There is no road access, but anglers can get to Namakan by boat from road access points located on Crane or Kabetogama lakes, or by portage from Rainy Lake. Namakan has high quality populations of several species of gamefish that are monitored annually with a fall gill netting survey.  <br> \n <br> \nThe 2020 catch rate for Black Crappie was down from the previous year. The few Black Crappie sampled during this survey were all from the 2018 year class and measured 6 to 7 inches in length. Sampling in previous years has shown there are large Black Crappie in Namakan. However, this species is rarely caught in great abundance with the standard survey gear used on Namakan, making it difficult to assess the status of this population.  <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike catch rates were slightly above the historic average for Namakan. This lake supports a fairly low density population with excellent trophy potential. The average weight of Northern Pike in the 2020 survey was nearly 4 pounds. Pike recruitment is fairly consistent in Namakan. Ten year classes were sampled in 2020, with the oldest pike being an 11 year old measuring 38.5 inches.  <br> \n <br> \nSauger catch rates were near the historic average for Namakan. Sauger here are typically small and slow growing, however there are plenty that reach harvestable sizes for anglers. The average length was over 10 inches and the largest was nearly 16 inches. The 2015 year class was the strongest of the sample, making up almost half of the Sauger caught in 2020.  <br> \n <br> \nBass are not typically caught in great numbers in nets. However, the high abundance of Smallmouth Bass in Namakan usually provides a fair number of fish in the standard survey nets. The catch rates in 2020 were greater than what would be expected for this type of lake. The size of the Smalmouth Bass was also larger than average. The average size in 2020 was about 2 pounds and 15 inches. Smallmouth ages ranged from 4 to 8 years old.  <br> \n <br> \nWalleye catch rates were slightly above average. The average size was just over 13 inches and average weights came in at about 1 pound. Namakan has the ability to produce trophy Walleye. The largest sampled in 2021 was a 14 year old measuring over 28 inches. The strongest year class ever sampled occurred in 2006, and because Walleye reach fairly old ages in Namakan these fish are still prevalent throughout the lake. Walleye recruitment has been very consistent in Namakan, with relatively average year classes being produced annually over the past decade.  <br> \n <br> \nYellow Perch catch rates were similar to the historic average for Namakan. These are an important forage species for larger predators. However, the sizes available in Namakan should also be of interest to many anglers. The average size in 2020 was 7.6 inches, and the largest was 12 inches. Ages ranged from 2 to 9 years. The majority of the Yellow Perch sampled were from the 2016 and 2018 year classes.  <br> \n <br> \nOther species sampled in 2020 included Burbot, Cisco, Lake Sturgeon, Pumpkinseed, Redhorse, Rock Bass, Silver Lamprey, and White Sucker. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Namakan Lake is a 25,130 acre, softwater lake, located along the border between Minnesota and the Province of Ontario. The lake has a rocky irregular shoreline and tannin stained water typical of Canadian Shield lakes.  The Minnesota portion (12,322 acres) is located within the boundaries of Voyageurs National Park. Namakan Lake is part of the Namakan Reservoir, which also includes Crane, Kabetogama, Little Vermilion and Sand Point lakes. There is no road access on the Minnesota side of the lake. Thus, most anglers gain access by traveling via boat or snowmobile from road access points located on Crane or Kabetogama Lakes.  A mechanical portage does exist at Kettle Falls located where Namakan flows into the east end of Rainy Lake.\n\nFourteen species were present in the 2006 Fall Assessment gill netting on Namakan Lake.  Walleye was the most common species in the catch making up 34% of the total by number. Cisco and yellow perch were also common.  Walleye also had the highest total weight in the catch.  Northern pike also contributed a considerably to the total weight of the catch.\n\nWalleye abundance in 2006 (8.70/net) was consistent with the trend of improved abundance since standardized sampling began in 1983.  While abundance is improving, variability in catches is decreasing indicating more stability in population numbers.  The abundance of walleye over 17 inches in length also appears to be increasing.  Twenty-four percent of the total catch were of fish over 17 inches.  Lengths of walleye averaged 13.2 inches. Walleye growth for Namakan Lake was slower than the Area and Statewide averages.\n\nTwelve year-classes were present in the walleye catch and ages ranged from 0-12 years. Most walleye were from the 2003 and 2004 year-classes (44% of captured walleye) and the 2001 year-class (18% of captured walleye).  More young of the year walleye were captured in the nets than ever before.  High catches of young of the year walleye have been indicative of strong year-classes in the past.   \n\nNorthern pike abundance (1.60/net) in 2006 was less than in 2005 but was comparable to the longterm median for Namakan Lake.  In spite of the drop in 2006, gill-net abundance has increased since the early 1990's.  Lengths of captured northern pike ranged from 16.1 to 33.0 inches with an average of 24.2 inches.  Growth of Namakan Lake northern pike was considerably faster than the Area median.  The 2001 and 2003 year-classes appear to be strong in number.\n\nAlthough gill-net catches of smallmouth bass on Namakan Lake tend to be variable, they do indicate that bass abundance has increased since the early 1960's.  The 2006 gill-net catch (0.30/net) was approximately equal to the historical lake median as well as the median for this lake class.  The bass caught during this investigation averaged 13.1 inches in length with the largest individual being 19.4 inches. Growth of Namakan Lake smallmouth bass exceeded the Area median. \n\nOther species present in the gill-net catch included black bullhead, black crappie, bluegill, burbot, lake whitefish, pumpkinseed, rock bass, sauger, cisco, white sucker and yellow perch.\n\n</p>",

There is no road access to several of the lakes.  Thus, anglers gain access by traveling by boat from road access points located on Crane or Kabetogama lakes.   <br> \n <br> \nBlack crappie abundance was better than the expected range for this lake type.  Black crappie fishing has become more popular recently on Namakan Lake, especially in winter.  Most anglers have been attracted by the large crappies present in Namakan Lake.  The largest crappie captured during the 2011 fisheries investigation was 11.2 inches.   <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike abundance was above the expected range for this lake type.  Abundance has increased 38 percent since 2000; the year which the rule-curve used to regulate water levels was changed to enhance northern pike spawning habitat.  Size remains impressive and anglers have a good chance to catch very large northern pike.  Our sample in 2011 found fish up to 42.1 inches.    <br> \n <br> \nSauger are present but generally are rare and sizes are small.  The average size sampled in 2011 was 10.2 inches and the average weight was 0.28 pounds.   <br> \n <br> \nSmallmouth bass is another choice for anglers visiting Namakan Lake.  Abundance in 2011 was above the expected range for this lake type.  The average size in our sample was 14.2 inches, a fun size for anglers.  Typically, anglers also catch some very large fish while targeting smallmouth bass on Namakan Lake.  Some true trophy-sized fish are out there; the largest in our 2011 sample was 18.3 inches.   <br> \n <br> \nWalleye abundance was within the expected range for this lake type.  Size in the sample ranged from 3.6-24.1 inches. Walleye ranged from 0-17 years old and age-5 fish represented 38 percent of the sample.  The walleye born in 2006 are the third strongest year-class in the past 25 years.  These fish will continue to grow larger and provide opportunities for great fishing in the future.     <br> \n <br> \nYellow perch abundance was within the expected range for this lake type.  Currently, sizes exist that are attractive to anglers.  The range was from 5.5-11.5 inches and the mean was 7.8.  </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Introduction <br> \nThis investigation was designed to document the population characteristics of Lake Whitefish (Coregonus clupeaformis) found in Namakan and Sand Point Lakes, Minnesota. Changes in water level management first enacted by the International Joint Commission (IJC) in 2000 were expected to be beneficial to Lake Whitefish in the Namakan Reservoir. Lake Whitefish spawn in shallow water during October and November with eggs hatching early in the following spring. Whitefish eggs, therefore, are susceptible to desiccation during winters with significant water level drawdown.   <br> \n <br> \nThis investigation used the Fish Community Index Netting (FCIN) protocol developed by the Province of Ontario (LNFAU 2001) to collect long-term population characteristics of Lake Whitefish in Namakan and Sand Point Lakes. FCIN is carried out on a two out of four year rotation. The 2021 sampling season represents the first of two surveys in the current four year rotation on the Namakan Reservoir.  <br> \nMethods <br> \n <br> \nNine FCIN nets were set from August 15th through August 18rd, 2021 on Namakan Lake. Three additional sets were made on Sand Point Lake on August 18th and lifted on August 19th. Sets were approximately 24-hours in duration. Gill nets used were eight feet tall and consisted of nine 50-foot panels of various mesh gill net (1.0, 2.25, 0.75, 1.5, 2.5, 1.75, 0.5, 2.0, and 1.25 inch bar measure). Net locations were selected to sample two depth strata (50'-90' and greater than 90'). Six nets were set in the shallow-water stratum and three were set in the deep-water stratum of Namakan Lake, and two were set in the shallow-water stratum and one in the deep-water stratum of Sand Point Lake (Figure 1). Net location and orientation was chosen randomly within strata across the entire lake. However, nets could not be within 330 feet of shore or exposed shoals.  <br> \n <br> \nAll fish captured in each net were separated by species and capture mesh. Total length, weight, sex, and state of maturity were recorded for all Lake Whitefish captured. Otoliths were collected from Lake Whitefish for aging.  <br> \n <br> \nFive metrics were incorporated to track long-term trends in the Lake Whitefish population (LNFAU 2001). <br> \n1)\tMean age of first maturity <br> \n2)\tMean age of FCIN catch <br> \n3)\tRelative abundance (Catch per unit effort (CPUE)) <br> \n4)\tRecruitment/ juvenile abundance (CPUE of age 3, 4 and 5) <br> \n5)\tSpatial distribution of FCIN catch <br> \n <br> \nResults and Discussion <br> \n <br> \nSeven species totaling 457 individual fish were caught in the 2021 summer FCIN assessment (Table 1). Cisco species were the most common fish by number and weight, making up 72.4 percent of the total catch by number and 31.9 percent of the catch by weight. Walleyes and Lake Whitefish made up the next largest portion of the total weight at 22.3 and 18.0 percent of the catch, respectively. Twenty-eight Lake Whitefish were sampled for a catch rate of 2.3 per lift. A total of 331 Cisco (27.6 per net), 40 Burbot (3.3 per net), 35 Walleyes (2.9 per net), 12 Sauger (1.0 per net), nine White Suckers (0.8 per net), and two Northern Pike (0.3 per net) were caught during the 2021 FCIN survey.  <br> \n <br> \nLake Whitefish ranged in length from 9.8 to 21.7 inches, with a mean of 16.3 (Table 2). The mean weight was 1.7 pounds. Twelve age-classes were represented in the 2021 catch with the age 7 year-class composing 25.0 percent of the total catch while the age 2 and age 5 year-classes each made up an additional 14.3 percent of the total catch (Table 3).  <br> \n <br> \nFive metrics for evaluating the Lake Whitefish population were calculated. The age of 50% maturity (females) was 10.6 years. The mean age of Lake Whitefish in the FCIN catch was 6.8 years. Recruitment criteria showed that the juvenile abundance (CPUE of age 3, 4, 5) of Lake Whitefish was 0.5 per net, although there were five additional juvenile fish caught that were less than age 3 (4 age-2 and 1 age-1). Lake Whitefish were sampled at 10 of 12 stations (Figure 2). <br> \n <br> \nFCIN sampling from recent years suggest the Lake Whitefish population is relatively stable. Sampling was carried out in a two of four year rotation resulting in 10 years of sampling between 2004 and 2021. Lake Whitefish catch rates have fluctuated between 1.33 per net and 4.60 per net and averaged 3.0 per net. There is no longer a commercial fishery for Lake Whitefish on the Minnesota side of the Namakan Reservoir and recreational harvest is likely low. There were several age classes of Lake Whitefish present in the 2021 catch with individuals up to 16 years old along with several juvenile fish. Consistent catch rates of juvenile Lake Whitefish suggest good reproduction and recruitment. Monitoring of the Lake Whitefish population for signs of stress should continue.      <br> \n <br> \nReferences <br> \nLNFAU, 1999.

WALLEYE SPUE WAS UP 59%, NORTHERN PIKE UP 28%, WHITE SUCKER UP 47%, ROCK BASS UP 43% AND SAUGER CPUE WAS UP 9%: HOWEVER, YELLOW PERCH CPUE WAS DOWN 13%. THE IN- CREASE IN THE INDEX OF ABUNDANCE OF MOST SPECIES MAY BE THE RESULT OF ENVIRONMENTAL VARIABLES IN- FLUENCING CPUE. CPUE WAS ABOVE THE LAKE MEAN FOR WALLEYE, YELLOW PERCH, WHITE SUCKER, AND CISCO; NORTHERN PIKE, ROCK BASS, AND SAUGER CPUE WAS BELOW THEIR RESPECTIVE LAKE MEANS. THE WALLEYE CPUE INCREASE MAY HAVE BEEN THE RESULT OF THE STRONG 1984 YEAR CLASS BECOMING VULNERABLE TO THE GEAR (THIS IS ALSO REFLECTED IN A DECREASE IN THE MEAN AGE). GROWTH RATES FOR WALLEYE AND SAUGER WERE SIMILAR TO 1986 VALUES. PAST BEACH SEINING (ANNUAL MEAN NO./HAUL) FOR WALLEYE DOES NOT APPEAR TO REFLECT RECRUITMENT TO AGE CLASS VULNERABLE TO GILL NET SETS FOR 1987 (HOWEVER STATISTICAL ANALYSIS OF SEINING DATA MAY SHOW THAT THERE WAS NO SIGNIFI- CANT DIFFERENCE BETWEEN YEARS DUE TO THE HIGH VARIABILITY IN CATCH/HAUL FOR SAMPLING PERIODS IN A YEAR).</p>",

The presence of the strong 1989 and 1990 year-classes should provide another year of good fishing for fish in the 14\" - 17\" size range.  Walleye up to 24.4\" long were sampled in test nets, with an average size of 13.9\", and 1.0 pounds.  Northern pike abundance has historically been on the low end of the range reported for lakes of this type.  However the northern pike in Namakan Lake are fast growing and large, with an average length of 25.8\", and 4.3 pounds in DNR test nets.  Sauger abundance remains within the normal range for similar lakes.  Average length of sauger sampled in test nets was 10.7\", and average weight was 0.4 pounds.  Lake whitefish, shorthead redhorse, smallmouth bass, tullibee (cisco), white sucker and yellow perch were all sampled in numbers commonly reported for these species in similar lakes.  Rock bass abundance was below average for lakes of this type.  In addition, 1 bluegill, 1 lake sturgeon, and 16 rainbow smelt were sampled in DNR test nets.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Namakan Lake is a 25,130 acre, softwater lake, located along the border between Minnesota and the Province of Ontario. Namakan Lake has a rocky irregular shoreline and tannin stained water typical of Canadian Shield type lakes.  The Minnesota portion (12,322 acres) is located within the boundaries of Voyageurs National Park. Namakan Lake is part of the Namakan Reservoir, which also includes Crane, Kabetogama, Little Vermilion and Sand Point lakes. There is no road access on the Minnesota portion of the lake. Thus, most anglers gain access by traveling by boat or snowmobile from road access points located on Crane or Kabetogama Lakes.  A mechanical portage does exist at Kettle Falls located where Namakan Lake flows into the east end of Rainy Lake.Fourteen species were present in the 2002 Fall Assessment gill netting on Namakan Lake.  Walleye was the most common species in the catch making up 34% of the total by number. Cisco, yellow perch and northern pike were also common.  Northern pike had the highest total weight in the catch.Walleye abundance in 2002 (8.25/net) was similar to that found in 2001 (9.90/net) and higher than the median catch of 6.85/net found in 28 previous investigations on this lake. Gill-net abundance has increased and become more stable in recent years.  The abundance of walleye over 17 inches in length also appears to be increasing.  Lengths of walleye averaged 12.1 inches and ranged from 3.8 to 22.2 inches. Walleye growth for Namakan Lake was slower than the Area and Statewide averages.Nine year-classes were present in the walleye catch and ages ranged from 0-8 years. Most walleye were from the 2001 year-class (29% of captured walleye) and the 1998 year-class (22% of captured walleye).  Fewer age-2 (2000 year-class) and age-3 (1999 year-class) walleye were captured than is normal for these age-groups.  Sixty-two percent of the strong 1996 year-class exceeded 17 inches in length and are now protected by regulation.  Northern pike abundance (1.95/net) exceeded the median of 1.62/net for lakes of this classification.  The 2002 northern pike gill-net catch also ranked at the 81st percentile of all fisheries investigations on Namakan Lake.  High abundance in 2002 was consistent with the positive trend in pike abundance noted since the early 1990's.  Lengths of captured northern pike ranged from 17.6 to 37.0 inches with an average of 24.6 inches.  The average weight for captured northern pike (3.61 pounds) exceeded the average for this lake class (3.52 pounds).  Growth of Namakan Lake northern pike was faster than the Area median.  Age-3 northern pike were the most common age-group present in the pike catch contributing 33% to the total.  The relatively high catch of age-1 pike (13% of the total) indicated that the 2001 cohort may be a strong year-class.Sauger abundance (1.55/net) in 2002 was the third lowest recorded of the 28 investigations conducted on Namakan Lake since 1962.  The lake class median was 3.45/net.  Sauger captured during the gill-net assessment were small; lengths ranged from 7.9 to 12.4 inches with an average of 10.2 inches.  Most sauger were from the 1998 year-class (55% of captured sauger).  Of the last nine years, only 1998 produced a strong sauger year-class.Although gill-net catches of smallmouth bass on Namakan Lake tend to be variable, they do indicate that bass abundance has increased since the early 1960's.  The 2002 gill-net catch (0.55/net) was the fifth highest on record for Namakan Lake and exceeded the median for this lake class.  Eight of the eleven bass caught exceeded 12 inches in length including a 20.7 inch individual.  Growth of Namakan Lake smallmouth bass exceeded the Area median. Other species present in the gill-net catch included black bullhead, black crappie, bluegill, lake sturgeon, redhorse, rock bass, silver lamprey, cisco, white sucker and yellow perch.   </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Namakan is a 25,130 acre lake located along the border between Minnesota and the Province of Ontario.  The Minnesota portion (12,314 acres) is located in Voyageurs National Park.  Namakan Lake is part of the Namakan Reservoir, which also consists of Crane, Kabetogama, Little Vermilion, and Sand Point lakes.  There is no road access on the Minnesota portion of Namakan Lake.  Thus, anglers gain access by traveling by boat from road access points located on Crane or Kabetogama lakes.       The fish community in Namakan is diverse with many species present.  Black crappies, burbot, cisco, lake sturgeon, lake whitefish, northern pike, rock bass, saugers, shorthead and silver redhorse, smallmouth bass, walleyes, white suckers, and yellow perch were captured during the assessment in 2003.            Black crappie gill-net abundance was 0.60 fish/set, which was the second highest level ever observed in Namakan Lake.  Total length (TL) ranged from 4.2-12.2 inches and the average was 9.0.  The average weight was above what is found in similar lakes.       Northern pike gill-net abundance (2.00 fish/set) was above the historical average for Namakan Lake (1.62 fish/set).  Seven year-classes were present and age ranged from 1-7 years.  Total length ranged from 16.1-38.8 inches and the growth rate was much higher than the statewide and area averages.  The average weight was also above the average observed in similar lakes.       Walleye gill-net abundance was 6.60 fish/set, which was below the average since 1983 of 7.57.  Walleye abundance has decreased since 2001, mostly due record numbers of fish in several year-classes moving into the unprotected zone of the slot limit and the subsequent angling harvest.  In 2003, eleven walleye year-classes were present and age ranged from 1-11 years.  The 2001 year-class was abundant and represented 37% of the sample.  These fish should keep anglers busy in the summer of 2004, as they will be near the lower end of the harvest slot.  The average length for walleyes captured in the 2003 assessment was 12.3 inches and the range was 6.0-21.6.  Growth rate and average weight were well below the area and statewide averages.         Yellow perch gill-net abundance was 1.45 fish/set, which was second lowest level ever recorded for Namakan Lake.  Five year-classes were present and age ranged from 2-7 years.  Age-4 fish represented 38% of the sample.  Total length ranged from 5.5-9.4 inches and the average was 7.5.  Growth was slightly above the area average, but below the statewide average.   </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Namakan Lake is a 25,130 acre, softwater lake, located along the border between Minnesota and the Province of Ontario. The lake has a rocky irregular shoreline and tannin stained water typical of Canadian Shield lakes.  The Minnesota portion (12,322 acres) is located within the boundaries of Voyageurs National Park. Namakan Lake is part of the Namakan Reservoir, which also includes Crane, Kabetogama, Little Vermilion and Sand Point lakes. There is no road access on the Minnesota side of the lake. Thus, most anglers gain access by traveling via boat or snowmobile from road access points located on Crane or Kabetogama Lakes.  A mechanical portage does exist at Kettle Falls located where Namakan flows into the east end of Rainy Lake.\n\nTwelve species were present in the 2007 Fall Assessment gill netting on Namakan Lake.  Walleye was the most common species in the catch making up 26% of the total by number. Yellow perch were also common.  Northern pike contributed a considerable portion of the catch by weight followed by walleye and white sucker.  The 2007 investigation marked the 25th year of annual assessment netting on the Minnesota waters of Namakan Lake.\n\nWalleye abundance in 2007 (6.80/net) had declined somewhat since 2006 but was still consistent with the overall trend of improved abundance since standardized sampling began in 1983.  While abundance has improved, variability in catches has decreased indicating more stability in population numbers.  The abundance of walleye over 17 inches in length also has increased.  Twenty-six percent of the total catch were of fish over 17 inches.  Lengths of walleye averaged 13.7 inches. Walleye growth for Namakan Lake was slower than the Area and Statewide averages.\n\nThirteen year-classes were present in the walleye catch and ages ranged from 1-13 years. Most walleye were from the 2004 and 2006 year-classes (45% of captured walleye).  Other strong year-classes also are present in the population including 2001, 1999 and 1996.    \n\nNorthern pike abundance (2.45/net) in 2007 was the highest recorded since 1962.  Pike abundance has demonstrated an increasing trend since the early 1990's.  The abundance of large pike in the population also appears to be increasing.  Lengths of northern pike sampled ranged from 18.1 to 37.4 inches and averaged of 25.1 inches.  Numbers of pike over 30 inches have also been increasing since the early 1990's.  Except for the 2004 year-class, pike recruitment has been consistent and strong since 2001. Growth of Namakan Lake northern pike was considerably faster than the Area median.\n\nAlthough gill-net catches of smallmouth bass on Namakan Lake tend to be variable, they do indicate that bass abundance has increased since the early 1960's.  The 2007 gill-net catch (0.95/net) was the highest on record for Namakan Lake and were exceptional when compared to other lakes in the same classification.  The bass caught during this investigation averaged 11.5 inches in length with the largest individual being 19.4 inches. Growth of Namakan Lake smallmouth bass exceeded the Area median. \n\nOther species present in the gill-net catch included black crappie, lake whitefish, rock bass, sauger, shorthead redhorse, silver redhorse, cisco, white sucker and yellow perch.  \n\n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Namakan Lake is located on the border between Minnesota and the Province of Ontario and is part of the Namakan Reservoir, which also consists of Crane, Kabetogama, Little Vermilion, and Sand Point lakes.  There is no road access to several of the lakes.  Thus, anglers gain access by traveling by boat from road access points located on Crane or Kabetogama lakes.   <br> \n <br> \nBlack Crappie abundance was within the expected range for this lake type.  Black Crappie fishing has become more popular recently on Namakan Lake, especially in winter.  Most anglers have been attracted by the large Crappies present in Namakan Lake.  The largest Crappie captured during the 2016 fisheries investigation was 10.8 inches.   <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike abundance was the second highest level ever recorded on Namakan Lake above the expected range for this lake type.  The rule-curve used to regulate water levels was changed in 2000 to enhance Northern Pike spawning habitat.  Long-term trends suggest that the change in water levels has increased Northern Pike abundance.  Size remains impressive and anglers have a good chance to catch very large Northern Pike.  The sample in 2016 included fish up to 44.4 inches.   <br> \n <br> \nSauger are present but generally not abundant and sizes are small.  The average size sampled in 2016 was 10.0 inches and the average weight was 0.27 pounds.   <br> \n <br> \nSmallmouth Bass is another choice for anglers visiting Namakan Lake.  Abundance in 2016 was well above the expected range for this lake type.  The average size in our sample was 13.0 inches, a fun size for anglers.  Typically, anglers also catch some very large fish while targeting Smallmouth Bass on Namakan Lake.   <br> \n <br> \nWalleye abundance was within the expected range for this lake type.  Long-term trends indicate at least a 10 percent increase in Walleye abundance since a size regulation was implemented in 1998.  The regulation has also improved the size structure; older, larger fish are now more abundant.  In 2016, 15 year-classes were present and age ranged from 1-20 years.  The 2006 year-class was the strongest in over 25 years and remains prominent.  Recent year-classes look promising as well, especially the 2011 and 2012 year-classes which represented 47 percent of the sample.  Size in the 2016 sample ranged from 6.9-26.1 inches and average weight was 0.90 pounds. <br> \n <br> \nYellow Perch abundance was within the expected range for this lake type.  Currently, sizes exist that are attractive to anglers.  The size range was from 5.6-11.0 inches and the average was 7.6.  </p>",
