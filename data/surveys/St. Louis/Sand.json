There is no public access located on this lake.  <br> \n <br> \nFour gill nets and nine trap nets were used to sample the fish populations in 2015. Eight species of fish were sampled. Bluegill, black crappie and northern pike were most commonly sampled in the nets. <br> \n <br> \nBluegill numbers were above average compared to similar lakes in this area. The average bluegill sampled was 6.5 inches long and about 6 years old. Seventeen percent of the bluegill were 8 inches or longer. <br> \n <br> \nBlack crappie abundance was above average compared to similar lakes in this area. Two years classes seem to dominate the catch, which is typical of a species that has uneven recruitment. The larger crappie were of a size that anglers like to keep. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike numbers were above average compared to similar lakes in this area. Most pike sampled were under 24 inches long, with the largest just under 33 inches. <br> \n <br> \nThree large walleye were sampled. Pumpkinseed and golden shiner were also present. Yellow perch and white sucker were sampled in relatively low numbers. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Little Sand Lake is typical of the 66 lakes in its ecological lake class, except that it is smaller and less chemically fertile.  It was partially stratified thermally in July, 1995, with a surface temperature of 73 F and a bottom temperature of 63 F.  There was little oxygen below 11 ft.The total catch of fish (all species combined) in the trapnets and gillnets was lower than average for lakes in this lake class.  Most of the game fish had Neascus, also known as \"black spot\", which is a harmless parasite that does not make the flesh unpalatable.Fish populations in 1995 were dominated by northern pike and bluegill sunfish.  Northern pike numbers were average for this lake class.  Most pike were small, but a 26\" and a 32\" northern pike were captured.Bluegill numbers were above average for this lake class.  Bluegill reproduction has been erratic, with strong year classes prior to 1992 and in 1995.  Weak year classes in 1992 and 1993 were expected since these cold summers produced poor year classes in many lakes.  The apparent poor year class in 1994 is a surprise for which we have no explanation.  Bluegill growth was average, but the size structure of the population was very good, with 40 percent of the catch equal to or greater than 8\".  Other major species present in 1995 were white sucker, yellow perch, and walleye.  Sucker numbers were average for this lake class.  Many young perch from the 1995 year class were present, but few older ones were caught and most of these were small.  Walleye numbers were average for this lake class, but lakes in this class usually have few walleye.  Walleye growth was average, and a number of different ages were present.  Walleye up to 23\" were present.Low numbers of black crappie were present but the size structure was good, with crappie up to 12\" present.  Crappie were relatively free of Neascus.  An 18\" largemouth bass was caught twice in trapnets during this assessment.  Golden shiner were common in the small mesh trapnets.</p>",
