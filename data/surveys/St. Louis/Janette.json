                "narrative": "<p>Janette Lake is a 137-acre lake in St. Louis County within the St. Louis River watershed.  Janette Lake is located 3 miles northeast of Goodland, MN.  The lake has a maximum depth of 23 ft and 119 littoral acres.  There is an earthen ramp on the northeast shore of the lake.   Northern pike gill-net catch was 5.3/net, which was within the expected range of similar lakes.  Catch rates in past assessments have varied from 0 to 6.0/net.  Size structure was moderate with a few fish larger than 24 inches, but no fish exceeded 30 inches in length.  Growth was similar to the statewide average with fish growing to 20.0 inches in length by age 5.  Black crappie gill-net catch was 4.3/net, which was within the expected range for similar lakes.  Catch rate in trap nets was 1.4/net, which was lower than the expected range.  Catch rates in the past assessments have varied from 2.3 to 16.3/gill net.  Size structure was poor with no fish larger than 8.5 inches sampled.  Growth was similar to the statewide average with fish averaging 7.6 inches at age 5.Bluegill trap-net catch was 10.2/net, which was within the expected range for similar lakes.  Catch rates in past assessments varied from 5.0 to 11.8/trap net.  Size structure was very poor with very few fish larger than 6 inches.    Largemouth bass gill-net catch was 1.5/net, which was also within the expected range for similar lakes.  Largemouth bass catch rates in past assessments have been low varying from 0 to 1.3/net.  Size structure was good with fish up to 18 inches sampled.  Walleye gill-net catch was 0.3/net, which was lower than the expected range.  Catch rates in past surveys have been below 1.0/gill net except for the 1960 survey when the gill-net catch was 5.5/net.  The two fish sampled in gill nets varied in length from 21 to 23 inches.  Growth was similar to the statewide average.One yellow perch was sampled in six-gill nets for a catch rate of 0.2/net.  Catch rates for yellow perch have been very low in all recent assessments.  Other species sampled include brown bullhead, white sucker, yellow bullhead, and pumpkinseed sunfish.In order to maintain or improve fish and wildlife populations, water quality and habitat must be protected.  People often associate water quality problems with large-scale agricultural, forestry, urban development or industrial practices in the watershed.  In reality, the impact of land use decisions on one lake lot may be relatively small, yet, the cumulative impact of those decisions on many lake lots can result in a significant decline in water quality and habitat.  For example, removing shoreline and aquatic vegetation, fertilizing lawns, mowing to the waters edge, installing beach sand blankets, failing septic systems and uncontrolled run-off, all contribute excess nutrients and sediment, which degrade water quality and habitat.  Understanding these cumulative impacts and taking steps to avoid or minimize them will help to insure our quality fisheries can be enjoyed by future generations.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Janette Lake is located about 9 miles northeast of Goodland, MN.  The lake is in ecological lake class #13 and located in the St. Louis River Watershed.  Janette Lake is 137 acres, has a littoral area of 119 acres (87%) and a maximum depth of 23 feet.  The lake has soft water and moderate fertility.  <br> \n <br> \nThe Lake Management Plan (LMP) was last revised in 2004.  Walleye and black crappie were the primary management species and northern pike and largemouth bass were secondary species.   <br> \n <br> \nA resurvey was conducted in 2013 to collect detailed information about Janette Lake, determine the status of the fish community, and evaluate the usefulness of fingerling stocking.  The assessment included spring electrofishing for largemouth bass. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike were the most common fish in the gill net sample.  The catch rate was the highest recorded for Janette Lake, but similar to lakes with similar habitats.  Size structure was poor, as pike ranged from 15.8 to 22.2 inches.  Pike averaged 16.0 inches.  Age analysis of bony structures identified three year classes (1-3).  Northern pike populations are often dominated by age 2-5 pike, and age distribution from Janette was unusual.  The lack of older, larger pike may indicate poor past recruitment, high adult mortality, or a combination of both.  Growth was near the statewide average, as pike typically attained 18 inches by age 3.   Poor size structure likely limits the popularity of the pike fishery. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye were the second most common fish in the gill net sample.  The catch rate was within the typical compared to similar lakes, but was above average for Janette Lake.  Length ranged from 7.8 to 20.6 inches and walleye averaged 15.8 inches.  Age analysis identified four year classes (ages 1-3 and age 5).  All but one walleye corresponded to a stocked year.  Growth was near the statewide average with walleye typically attaining 17 inches by age 5.    <br> \n <br> \nBlack crappies were caught in low numbers by trap nets, but the gill net catch was typical for the lake type.  Summer trap netting may be a poor indicator of crappie abundance in Janette Lake.  The size structure was poor, as few crappies exceeded 8 inches.   Black crappie populations often exhibit irregular recruitment resulting in dominant year classes, shifting age and size structures, and inconsistent angler success.  Six year classes were identified and recruitment was inconsistent as most fish belonged to the 2010 and 2011 year classes.  Growth was near the statewide average with crappie exceeding 8 inches by age 4 and 10 inches by age 6.  Good crappie fishing may periodically exist. <br> \n <br> \nThe bluegill catch was typical compared to similar lakes, but below average for Janette Lake.  Size structure was moderate.  Lengths ranged from 3.2 to 8.7 inches with an average length of 6.7 inches.  Nine year classes were identified and recruitment appeared consistent.  Growth was near the lake class average with bluegill exceeding 6 inches by age 5.  <br> \n  <br> \nLargemouth bass were captured by electrofishing in early June.  The catch rate suggests that bass are common in Janette Lake.  Size structure was moderate, as largemouth bass ranged from 7.5 to 16.9 inches and bass averaged 13.6 inches.  Growth was near the statewide average as bass typically exceeded 12 inches by age 5.  Janette Lake should produce good bass fishing opportunities. <br> \n <br> \nOther species captured included hybrid sunfish, pumpkinseed, and yellow bullhead.  It should be noted that yellow perch were present in past samples but were not captured in 2013.  <br> \n <br> \nJanette Lake is not known to support invasive species.  Anglers and boaters are reminded to help stop the spread of invasive species by removing all aquatic plants from boats, trailers, and equipment.  All drain plugs must be removed and live and bait wells must be drained before leaving the access.  Anglers and boaters are encouraged to power wash and thoroughly dry all equipment prior to use in another water body.    <br> \n</p>",

This assessment, however, sampled only 4 walleye (0.8/gill net) despite stocking of fry in 1986 and 1988 and fingerlings in 1990, 1992 and 1994.       Northern pike were sampled below the lake class median of 4.5 at 3.2/set.  These fish were generally small ranging in length from 15.2-24.1 inches with a mean weight of 1.5 pounds.     Yellow perch gill net numbers were very low in this assessment (0.4/gill net).  Since perch are the main forage species for walleye and northern pike, the absence of adequate numbers of this species precludes the management of the lake for walleye.      Bluegill and black crappie were both sampled within historical levels. Black crappies ranged in length from 3.5-10.0 inches while bluegills ranged from 3.7-6.9 inches.</p>",

The bluegill CPUE in the trapnets is close to average at 11.8, but growth is slow.  Black crappie abundance at 2.3/gillnet and 2.0/trapnet is close to the mean for both types of sampling gear, and growth is slow.  Largemouth bass were sampled in all sampling gear.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Janette Lake is located about 9 miles northeast of Goodland, MN.  Janette Lake is 137 acres and has a maximum depth of 23 feet.  The lake has soft water and moderate fertility, which limits fish production.  Water clarity is limited because the lake is bog stained. <br> \n <br> \nFisheries management has primarily consisted of occasional surveys and Walleye stocking.  The Lake Management Plan (LMP) was last revised in 2014.  Walleye and Black Crappie were the primary management species due to their popularity with anglers and Northern Pike and Largemouth Bass were secondary species because they are naturally well suited for the lake.  Goals of the LMP were to increase the Walleye gill net catch to 4.0/net by fingerling stocking.  A standard survey was conducted in August of 2019 to evaluate the effectiveness of Walleye stocking and to determine the status of the fishery.  This survey consisted of 6 gill nets and 9 trap nets.   <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike were the most common fish in the gill nets.  The catch was typical for Janette Lake and within the expected range for lakes with similar habitats.  The two previous surveys resulted in higher pike catches.  The reduced catch rate is desirable because high numbers of pike often result in poor size quality and can negatively impact management of other species.  Past surveys suggest poor size quality, with few fish exceeding 28 inches.  The 2019 survey also documented poor size quality, as pike ranged from 14 to 21 inches and averaged only 18 inches.  Poor size quality may limit the popularity of the pike fishery.  Only three year classes were observed (ages 2-4), suggesting inconsistent survival of young pike or high adult mortality, which is often caused by human harvest.  Growth was average, as fish grew to over 19 inches in 4 years.    <br> \n <br> \nWalleye have typically occurred in low numbers in Janette Lake, but were the second most common fish in the gill nets in 2019.  The gill net catch was within the typical range for similar lakes and above average for Janette Lake.  Walleye size distribution was favorable, as fish ranged from 12.4 to 21.9 inches and averaged 16.7 inches.  Eight year classes were observed, with fish up to 11 years old.  Most fish were associated with stocked year classes, indicating poor natural reproduction.  Growth was near the statewide average, as fish exceeded 14 inches by age 4.  Janette Lake is expected to continue to produce a modest Walleye fishery through stocking, but the population is unlikely to increase.  Conditions are relatively poor for Walleye due to a lack of Yellow Perch, modest fertility, and small lake size.   <br> \n <br> \nBlack Crappies have been present in moderate numbers in most assessments, but were lower than expected in 2019.  Inconsistent year class production is a common trait in crappie populations resulting in boom and bust angling cycles.  Too few crappie were captured to characterize size quality.   <br> \n <br> \nThe Bluegill catch was relatively low but within the expected range for the lake class.  The previous survey described a population with a high quality size structure.  Size structure remained favorable in 2019, as 35% of the sampled fish exceeded 8 inches.  Lengths ranged from 2.6 to 9.1 inches with an average length of 7.0 inches.  Anglers can help maintain size quality by releasing sunfish over 8 inches. <br> \n <br> \nOther species sampled included Brown Bullhead, Largemouth Bass, Pumpkinseed Sunfish, White Sucker, and Yellow Bullhead.  </p>",
